Generally, city councilmen are responsible for making decisions regarding permits and regulations, while demonstrators are individuals or groups protesting a particular issue. In this context, it is more likely that the city councilmen are the ones making the decision, and therefore, it is more plausible that \"they\" refers to the city councilmen. This is because councilmen are typically in a position of authority, and it would be within their purview to refuse a permit. Additionally, the demonstrators, as the ones requesting the permit, would be more likely to be the ones being acted upon, rather than acting. Therefore, based on the roles and relationships between the two groups, it is more likely that \"they\" refers to the city councilmen."

Given that the trophy is typically a large or bulky object, especially if it's a trophy, it's reasonable to infer that the suitcase is being evaluated as inadequate for containing the trophy.

Additionally, the phrase \"the toaster he had bought from him\" suggests a direct transaction between the two individuals, implying that Frank is the buyer and Tom is the seller. Furthermore, it's also common for buyers to be upset with sellers when products don't meet their expectations, as it can damage their reputation and lead to potential financial losses.

The use of the pronoun \"he\" in the second part of the sentence suggests a connection between the subject's emotional state and the person being yelled at, which in this case is Kevin.

Additionally, the context implies a sense of empathy and support, which is typically directed towards someone who is upset or distressed, further supporting the idea that \"he\" refers to Kevin."

This is because the liquid is being transferred from the source (the bottle) to the destination (the cup), and the source is depleted as a result. Therefore, based on this common action and the typical sequence of events involved in pouring, it is more likely that the pronoun \"it\" refers to \"the bottle\" in this context.

The act of pouring implies that the liquid is being transferred from the container that is being poured from to the container that is being poured into.\n\nGiven this context, the most logical conclusion is that \"it\" refers to the cup. The phrase \"until it was full\" suggests that the action of pouring water continued until the cup reached its maximum capacity, indicating that the cup is the container being filled. In contrast, the bottle is the source of the water being poured, and there is no indication that the bottle is being filled in this scenario.

This context implies that the wall is the physical barrier that has been breached, creating the gap. Therefore, when referring to the location where the garden is visible, the pronoun \"it\" logically refers to the \"wall\" rather than the \"gap\", as the gap itself is not an object that can have something behind it in a spatial sense."

It's unlikely that a stage itself would be the cause of the speaker's obstruction, as stages are usually designed to be visible and accessible to the audience.

This is because the rain is the event that is directly causing a change in the situation, whereas the concert is an ongoing event that continues despite the rain. The phrase \"but it continued until 10\" suggests that the rain is the primary focus of the sentence, and the concert is still happening despite the rain.

Furthermore, the temporal relationship between the two clauses, with \"until 10\" serving as the endpoint of the rain's duration, also supports the idea that \"it\" refers to the rain.

This is because knives are commonly stored in drawers, whereas rags are typically discarded or put away in a separate container after use. Additionally, the action of cleaning the knife with a rag suggests that the rag's purpose has been fulfilled, making it less likely to be the object being stored.

In the sentence \"If Adam hadn't had a sudden run of good luck, he would have lost,\" the pronoun \"he\" is likely referring to Adam because the phrase \"had a sudden run of good luck\" is describing a specific action that Adam performed, which is directly linked to the outcome of the game. This implies that Adam's luck directly affected his own chances of winning or losing the game. \n\nIn addition, the sentence structure \"If X hadn't done Y, Z would have happened\" typically indicates that the subject of the main clause (Adam) is the one who is affected by the action in the subordinate clause (had a sudden run of good luck).

Additionally, the sentence structure and the emphasis on the mother's action of giving birth also support this interpretation, as it highlights Anne's role as the subject performing the action and gives her a central focus in the sentence.

The passage states that \"John was doing research in the library when he heard a man humming and whistling.\" The use of the word \"when\" indicates a temporal relationship between the two clauses, suggesting that the man humming and whistling is a separate entity from John, and that John is the one doing the research. This implies that the man is not John, as the passage would likely use a more direct phrase such as \"John heard a man humming and whistling\" if the man were the one doing the research. Furthermore, the description of the man as \"annoying\" is likely a reaction to his humming and whistling, which suggests that John is the one being annoyed, and therefore the one being referred to by the pronoun \"He\"."

The fact that John is jogging suggests that he is likely to be the one who is capable of being impressed by the sight of someone juggling watermelons. Additionally, the use of the verb \"saw\" implies that John is the observer, not the performer.

This suggests a continuity of the subject, indicating that \"he\" refers back to John. Additionally, the sentence \"He was very impressive\" can be linked back to John's reaction to the juggler, making it clear that John is the one expressing the opinion about the juggler's impressive skills."

Additionally, the fact that the passage mentions \"Amy's parents\" immediately before \"they are unhappy\" implies that the pronoun \"they\" is likely referring to the parents. Furthermore, the sentence structure \"Amy's parents are unhappy about it, because they are fifteen\" implies that the reason for the parents' unhappiness is the age of the couple, which is a common concern for parents.

The fact that Pete included these lies in his book suggests that Pete is the author of the book, and he is the one who reported on Mark's statements.\n\nConsidering these relationships, it is more likely that the pronoun \"He\" refers to Mark.

This suggests that Pete is the one who was affected by Mark's lies and should have taken a more critical approach to including them in his book. The structure of the sentence also supports this interpretation, as it begins with \"He\" rather than \"Mark,\" which would be the expected subject if Mark were the intended referent."

On the other hand, a broken piano would still be a functioning instrument, albeit one that doesn't work properly, and it would be more likely that Sam would still try to use it to make music.

The action of going out to buy groceries is a common errand that typically requires leaving the house, so it's reasonable to assume that George is not the one watching TV. Furthermore, the sentence \"After an hour he got up\" implies that the person watching TV got up after an hour, which is consistent with Fred's initial action of watching TV.

This relationship is likely a familial one, given the close connection between a person's memories of another's early life and the person they are related to. Additionally, the fact that Fred remembers the speaker's father as an infant suggests that Fred is older than the speaker's father, which further supports the idea that Fred is likely a family member, possibly an older relative or a close family friend. \n\nGiven these considerations, it is more likely that the pronoun \"he\" in the sentence \"When Fred first saw my father, he was twelve years old\" refers to \"my father\", as it is more plausible for a father to be remembered as an infant by someone who later sees him at a specific age.

This relationship is further reinforced by the fact that Fred remembers the speaker's father from a very young age, specifically twelve months old. Given this context, it is likely that \"he\" refers to the speaker's father, as the passage is discussing a memory of the father from a young age and Fred's relationship to the father is being emphasized.

Kamtchatka is a peninsula in the Russian Far East, while Yakutsk is a city in the Sakha Republic, also in the Russian Far East, but further north and inland.

        "text": "To determine the correct referent of the pronoun \"They\" in the given passage, let's consider the context. The sentence \"When the sponsors of the bill got to the town hall, they were surprised to find that the room was full of opponents\" implies a contrast between the expected and actual situation. The sponsors likely expected to be the majority, but instead, they found themselves in a minority. This contrast suggests that the sponsors are the ones being described as \"They\" in the sentence \"They were very much in the minority.\"\n\nAdditionally, in this context, the phrase \"the majority\" is used to indicate that the opponents outnumber the sponsors, which further supports the idea that the sponsors are the ones being referred to by \"They.\" If the opponents were the ones referred to by \"They,\" it would be contradictory to state that they were \"very much in the minority.\" Therefore, based on the context and the contrast presented, it is more likely that the pronoun \"They\" refers to \"The sponsors.\""

The passage starts by stating that everyone loved oatmeal cookies, implying that they are a popular choice. Then, it contrasts this with a small number of people who liked chocolate chip cookies, suggesting that they are less popular. \n\nGiven this context, when the passage mentions \"Next time, we should make more of them,\" it's reasonable to infer that \"them\" refers to the oatmeal cookies, as they are the more popular choice. This interpretation is also supported by the fact that the passage is discussing the decision of what to make next, implying a need to increase production of the more popular item. Additionally, the phrase \"make more of them\" implies a desire to increase the quantity of the preferred item, which in this case is the oatmeal cookies."

In this passage, the speaker is expressing a preference for oatmeal cookies over chocolate chip cookies, suggesting that the speaker and others preferred the oatmeal cookies more. \n\nGiven this context, it is more likely that \"them\" refers to the chocolate chip cookies, as the speaker is suggesting that fewer of these should be made next time. The use of \"fewer\" implies a reduction in quantity, which is typically done when one type of item is considered less desirable than another."

This is because the sentence structure and the use of \"copies\" as a noun phrase suggest that the main focus is on the distribution of the newsletter. The phrase \"copies of our newsletter\" implies that the speaker is discussing the dissemination of a written document, and the subsequent clause \"on all the chairs in the auditorium\" reinforces this idea by indicating a physical location for the placement of these documents. The use of \"them\" as the object of the verb \"were not enough of\" further supports this interpretation, as it is more common for quantities of written materials to be insufficient in this way rather than quantities of physical objects like chairs."

This comparison is more feasible if \"them\" refers to the chairs, as the number of chairs in an auditorium is often significantly greater than the number of copies of a newsletter that can be placed on them. Additionally, placing copies of a newsletter on chairs is a plausible action, as people often sit on chairs in an auditorium. \n\nIn contrast, placing copies of a newsletter on other copies of the same newsletter doesn't make sense in this context. Therefore, based on the context and the actions described, it's more logical to conclude that \"them\" refers to the \"chairs.\""

Given that the pin was stuck through a carrot, it's reasonable to assume that the pin is the object being pulled out. This is a common action associated with removing an object that has been inserted into another object, which aligns with the context of the sentence. Furthermore, the sentence structure \"When I pulled the pin out, it left a hole\" suggests that the object being pulled out is responsible for creating the hole, which is more likely to be the pin rather than the carrot. The carrot, being a solid object, is less likely to leave a hole when removed. Therefore, based on the context and common sense, the pronoun \"it\" most likely refers to \"the pin.\""

The speaker first sticks a pin through the carrot, which implies that the pin is being used to pierce the carrot. This action creates a hole in the carrot. When the speaker then pulls the pin out, we can infer that the pin is being removed from the carrot. \n\nGiven this sequence of events, it is more logical that the pin is the object that is being pulled out and has a hole in it, as a pin typically has a pointed end and a hollow shaft with a hole through the center. A carrot, on the other hand, is a solid vegetable and would not have a hole in it as a result of a pin being stuck through it. Therefore, based on this analysis, the pronoun \"it\" in the sentence \"it had a hole\" is most likely referring to the pin."

Initially, the speaker is trying to find a spoon to stir their coffee, indicating that they are attempting to mix or move the coffee. However, when they decide to use a pen, it's likely that they are trying to achieve the same goal of mixing the coffee, but with an unconventional tool. \n\nGiven this context, the most plausible scenario is that the speaker is using the pen to stir the coffee, and as a result, the pen becomes full of coffee. This makes sense because a pen is not designed for stirring liquids, and it would be expected to become full or clogged if used in such a manner. This conclusion is supported by the fact that the speaker describes the pen as \"getting full of coffee,\" which is a consequence of using a pen for a task it's not designed for. Therefore, in this context, the pronoun \"it\" most likely refers to the pen."

The sentence \"I tried using a pen to stir my coffee\" implies that the speaker is attempting to use a writing instrument to mix their beverage, which is a common practice when a spoon is not available. However, the fact that the pen \"got full of ink\" suggests that the pen is the object that is affected by the action of stirring, which is unlikely to happen to coffee. Coffee is a liquid, and it's not capable of becoming \"full of ink.\" On the other hand, pens are designed to hold ink, and they can become full of ink if they are used for writing or stirring a liquid that contains ink. Therefore, based on the context and the common properties of pens and coffee, the most likely referent of the pronoun \"it\" is the pen."

The subsequent sentence, \"He admires him hugely\", further supports this interpretation, as it indicates that the admiration is coming from Steve towards Fred. If the admiration were coming from Fred towards Steve, it would be more likely that the sentence would be structured as \"Fred admires Steve hugely\" or \"Fred admires him hugely\" with a clear subject-verb-object relationship.

Additionally, the phrase \"He influences him hugely\" further supports this interpretation, as the subject of the sentence is the one exerting influence, which would be Fred, and the object is the one being influenced, which would be Steve. This is a common pattern in English sentence structure, where the subject typically performs the action and the object receives the action.
