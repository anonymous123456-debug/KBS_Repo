The place of birth( POB) or birthplace is the place where a person was born. This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has\" sovereignty\" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" f\u00f6delsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively). A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\". Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\"). There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country). Some administrative forms may request the applicant's\" country of birth\". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\". For US citizens born abroad who under the US Constitution acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA( American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place. The far side of the Moon is the hemisphere of the Moon that always faces away from Earth. The far side's terrain is rugged with a multitude of impact craters and relatively few flat lunar maria compared to the near side. It has one of the largest craters in the Solar System, the South Pole \u2013 Aitken basin. Both sides of the Moon experience two weeks of sunlight followed by two weeks of night; even so, the far side is sometimes called the\" dark side of the Moon\", where\" dark\" is used to mean unseen rather than lacking sunlight. About 18 percent of the far side is occasionally visible from Earth due to libration. The remaining 82 percent remained unobserved until 1959, when it was photographed by the Soviet Luna 3 space probe. The Soviet Academy of Sciences published the first atlas of the far side in 1960. The Apollo 8 astronauts were the first humans to see the far side with the naked eye when they orbited the Moon in 1968. All manned and unmanned soft landings had taken place on the near side of the Moon, until 3 January 2019 when the Chang'e 4 spacecraft made the first landing on the far side. Astronomers have suggested installing a large radio telescope on the far side, where the Moon would shield it from possible radio interference from Earth. The near side of the Moon is the lunar hemisphere that is permanently turned towards Earth, whereas the opposite side is the far side. Only one side of the Moon is visible from Earth because the Moon rotates on its axis at the same rate that the Moon orbits the Earth \u2013 a situation known as synchronous rotation, or tidal locking. The Moon is directly illuminated by the Sun, and the cyclically varying viewing conditions cause the lunar phases. Sometimes the dark portion of the Moon is faintly visible due to earthshine, which is indirect sunlight reflected from the surface of Earth and onto the Moon. Since the Moon's orbit is both somewhat elliptical and inclined to its equatorial plane, libration allows up to 59% of the Moon's surface to be viewed from Earth( though only half at any moment from any point).\n\nQuestion:\nWhen was the director of film Far Side Of The Moon (Film) born?\n\nPlease give the answer directly without any explanation.", "results": "December 12, 1957", "reasoning_chains": []}

Alonso Mudarra( c. 1510 \u2013 April 1, 1580) was a Spanish composer of the Renaissance, and also played the vihuela, a guitar- shaped string instrument. He was an innovative composer of instrumental music as well as songs, and was the composer of the earliest surviving music for the guitar. Franz Peter Schubert (31 January 179719 November 1828) was an Austrian composer of the late Classical and early Romantic eras. Despite his short lifetime, Schubert left behind a vast oeuvre, including more than 600 secular vocal works (mainly lieder), seven complete symphonies, sacred music, operas, incidental music and a large body of piano and chamber music. His major works include the Piano Quintet in A major, D. 667 (\"Trout Quintet\"), the Symphony No. 8 in B minor, D. 759 (\"Unfinished Symphony\"), the \u201dGreat\u201d Symphony No. 9 in C major, D. 944, the three last piano sonatas (D. 958\u2013960), the opera \"Fierrabras\" (D. 796), the incidental music to the play \"Rosamunde\" (D. 797), and the song cycles \"Die sch\u00f6ne M\u00fcllerin\" (D. 795) and \"Winterreise\" (D. 911). Born in the Himmelpfortgrund suburb of Vienna, Schubert's uncommon gifts for music were evident from an early age. His father gave him his first violin lessons and his older brother gave him piano lessons, but Schubert soon exceeded their abilities. In 1808, at the age of eleven, he became a pupil at the Stadtkonvikt school, where he became acquainted with the orchestral music of Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven. He left the Stadtkonvikt at the end of 1813, and returned home to live with his father, where he began studying to become a schoolteacher; despite this, he continued his studies in composition with Antonio Salieri and still composed prolifically. In 1821, Schubert was granted admission to the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde as a performing member, which helped establish his name among the Viennese citizenry. He gave a concert of his own works to critical acclaim in March 1828, the only time he did so in his career. He died eight months later at the age of 31, the cause officially attributed to typhoid fever, but believed by some historians to be syphilis. Appreciation of Schubert's music while he was alive was limited to a relatively small circle of admirers in Vienna, but interest in his work increased significantly in the decades following his death. Felix Mendelssohn, Robert Schumann, Franz Liszt, Johannes Brahms and other 19th-century composers discovered and championed his works. Today, Schubert is ranked among the greatest composers of Western classical music and his music continues to be popular.

Joseph Little also known as Jack Little (25 January 1885 \u2013 1965) was an English professional footballer, who played for Croydon Common, Crystal Palace and Sittingbourne. John Albert Little( 13 October 1914 \u2013 25 November 1988) was an Australian politician. Born in Maryborough, Victoria, he was educated at East Brunswick and Thornbury state primary Schools, before becoming a clicker in a shoe factory in Collingwood, and later an official with the Victorian Boot Employees' Union, of which he was Federal President in 1944 and 1945. In 1952 was awarded a Commonwealth Bank Scholarship for six months, to study unionism and working conditions in the UK, Europe and the US. In 1954 he was elected to the Victorian Legislative Council for Melbourne North, representing the Labor Party. He left the Labor Party in 1955 and would be one of only two non-Catholic parliamentary members of the Australian Labor Party( Anti-Communist), the other being Robert Joshua, who became the leader of the party in the Australian House of Representatives. Little led the ALP( Anti-Communist) in the Legislative Council from 1955 until 1958, the last two of those years as leader of the Democratic Labor Party, which was the new name for the ALP( Anti-Communist). Little re-contested his Province at the expiry of his term in 1958, but like all other DLP candidates at that election he was defeated. On losing his seat in 1958 he purchased a newsagency in Reservoir, Victoria, which he ran until his election to the Australian Senate in 1968. Little successfully contested DLP preselection for the Senate in 1958, in which he defeated the original leader of the ALP( Anti-Communist) Les Coleman. It has been argued that Little was preferred as a DLP candidate because he was not a Catholic. The DLP was popularly regarded as a Catholic party, and a non-Catholic candidate had certain electoral attractions. Little contested Senate elections several times for the DLP. He was narrowly defeated by ALP candidate Charles Sandford in 1958, but he was successful in the 1967 Senate only election. Little had the same name as a well- known and popular Australian- American television wrestling commentator, and it has been suggested that promotion of Little's full name by the DLP, particularly in television advertising, was a factor that added to his vote. Little was defeated at the 1974 federal election, along with the other three DLP Senators( the fifth, Vince Gair, did not re-contest), when the party's vote collapsed. Jack Little died in 1988.

After the death of her father, the title passed to her uncle, William VII of Angoul\u00eame. After her marriage to Hugh IX of Lusignan, she became his consort, and the centre of the dynastic struggle between the Kings of England and France, after the death of Aymer of Angoul\u00eame. The defeat of John of England, ensured that the title passed to the House of Lusignan, eventually falling to the House of Valois and to the crown of France. William V of Angoul\u00eame, also known as William Taillefer III was the twelfth count of Angoul\u00eame. William V was born in 1084, the son of Count Fulk of Angoul\u00eame and the grandson of Geoffrey of Angoul\u00eame and Petronille de Archiac. William III's reign lasted from 1089 until 1118 or 1120. In 1108 he married Vitapoy de Benauges. They had one son, who succeeded William V as the thirteenth count of Angoul\u00eame. John of Orl\u00e9ans, Count of Angoul\u00eame and of P\u00e9rigord (26 June 1399 \u2013 30 April 1467), was a younger son of Louis I, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans, and Valentina Visconti, and a grandson of Charles V of France. He was the younger brother of the noted poet, Charles, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans, and grandfather of Francis I of France. John was taken hostage by the English in 1412, and not released until 1444. In 1415 he was joined by his older brother Charles, with whom he shared an interest in literature. He had to sell part of his estates to pay for his ransom, but still collected many books. After that, he fought under the orders of his illegitimate half-brother, Dunois, driving the English out of Guyenne in 1451. On 31 August 1449, he married Marguerite de Rohan, daughter of Alain IX of Rohan and Marguerite of Brittany. They had three children: He also had an illegitimate son, Jean de Valois, bastard of Angoul\u00eame, who was legitimised in 1458. \"Good Count John\" died in 1467. He is buried in the Cathedral of Angoul\u00eame. William VI of Angoul\u00eame( died 1179) was also known as William Taillefer IV. The eldest son of Count Wulgrin II of Angoul\u00eame and his first wife, Poncia, daughter of Roger the Poitevin and Almodis, he succeeded his father at the head of the county of Angoul\u00eame in 1140. William married Emma of Limoges( d?). He married a second time to Marguerite of Turenne, daughter of viscount Raymond I of Turenne. It is from him, that the territory was passed down through sons of William VI: Wulgrin III of Angoul\u00eame who was the eldest, William VII of Angoul\u00eame and Aymer of Angoul\u00eame. After the death of Aymer, the territory did not pass to Aymer's daughter, Isabella of Angoul\u00eame, Queen consort to John of England, but rather to the daughter of Wulgrim III, Mathilde of Angoul\u00eame, who had married Hugh IX of Lusignan, father of Hugh X of Lusignan. William VII of Angoul\u00eame( died 1186) was also known as William Taillefer V, was the Count of Angoul\u00eame from 1181. The second of three sons of William VI of Angoul\u00eame, he inherited the title of Count of Angoul\u00eame, and its territory, upon the death of his brother, Wulgrin III of Angoul\u00eame, who in turn had only one daughter, Mathilde of Angoul\u00eame. William VII died childless and the title passed to his youngest brother Aymer of Angoul\u00eame. Louis I of Orl\u00e9ans (13 March 1372 \u2013 23 November 1407) was Duke of Orl\u00e9ans from 1392 to his death. He was also, Duke of Touraine (1386\u20131392), Count of Valois (1386?\u20131406) Blois (1397\u20131407), Angoul\u00eame (1404\u20131407), P\u00e9rigord (1400\u20131407) and Soissons (1404\u201307). Louis was the second son of King Charles V of France and Joanna of Bourbon and was the younger brother of Charles VI. In 1498, his heirs male inherited the French throne after the extinction of the Valois main line. Turpio( or Turpion; died 4 October 863) was a Count of Angoul\u00eame in the Frankish empire. The sources are contradictory concerning the date of his appointment as count and his allegiance, but they agree that he died trying to fend off a raid by the Vikings. In 838, when the Emperor Louis the Pious led an army into Aquitaine to put down the rebellion of his grandson Pepin, he replaced the counts who had rallied to Pepin\u2014such as Turpio's brother Emeno, Count of Poitou\u2014with appointees of his own. According to Adhemar of Chabannes, writing in the early 11th century, Turpio was appointed Count of Angoul\u00eame. However, Lupus of Ferri\u00e8res, in a letter dated 840, addressed to either Abbot Marcward of Pr\u00fcm or perhaps Bishop Jonas of Orl\u00e9ans, makes a certain Rainald( Reinoldus), not Turpio, the new Count of Angoul\u00eame, and implies that Turpio was on the side of Pepin. Whenever Turpio's tenure began, its main feature was a series of Viking raids, culminating in the great raid of 862 \u2013 63, in which they allied with Pepin, besieged Toulouse and raided the Angoumois, killing Turpio in battle. The\" Chronicon Aquitanicum\" records, under the year 863, that\" Turpio, count of Angoul\u00eame, fought with the Northmen, killing their king, named Maurum, and himself being killed.\" The\" Annales Engolismenses\" provide a date for the battle, and Turpio's death: the fourth day of the nones of October 863. Their account is more detailed: Count Turpio\u2014a most strong knight and the best defender, a magnificent man, a lover of the clergy, a builder of churches and one who restored the poor\u2014joined the Northmen in battle, and killed Mauro, only then to be killed; and the whole region was captured and burned. Turpio was succeeded by his brother Emeno, who is recorded as Count of Angoul\u00eame at the time of his death in 866. Wulgrin III of Angoul\u00eame, also known as Wulgrin Taillefer II, inherited the title of Count of Angoul\u00eame and its territories from his father, William VI of Angoul\u00eame, in 1179. His untimely death was the first break in the house of Taillefer, which had ruled Angoul\u00eame since the days of the Carolingians. As he had only one daughter, Mathilde of Angoul\u00eame, the territory went to his younger brother, William VII of Angoul\u00eame. Wulgrin's daughter, Mathilde, would marry Hugh IX of Lusignan, who would eventually inherit the kingdom, over the claims of John of England, through Isabella of Angoul\u00eame, the daughter of Aymer of Angoul\u00eame, the third and youngest brother. Fulk of Angoul\u00eame was the eleventh count of Angoul\u00eame. He was the son of Count Geoffrey of Angoul\u00eame and Petronille De Archiac. He died in 1087 or 1089, depending on the sources. He had a son, who succeeded him in title and territory: William\" Taillefer\" I( died Aug 962) was also known as William II of Angoul\u00eame( being the second William in this family since Wulgrin I. His uncle, William I, being the first). He was the Count of Angoul\u00eame from 926 to 945. He was the son of Alduin I. According to one source, his surname, or sobriquet, was acquired due\" ... from the way in which he cut down a Norman Sea- king through his coat of mail.\" This Norman sea-king is identified as Storis. The name Taillefer was used by subsequent members of this family, especially holders of the title Count of Angoul\u00eame. William was not married, but had at least one, and possibly two, illegitimate sons who would later claim the title of Count of Angoul\u00eame.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat is the date of death of John, Count Of Angoul\u00eame's father?\n\nPlease give the answer directly without any explanation.", "results": "13 March 1372", "reasoning_chains": []}

Charles- Louis Balzac( 1752 \u2013 1820) was a French architect and architectural draughtsman. Charles Louis( 22 December 1799 \u2013 16 April 1883) was King of Etruria( 1803 \u2013 1807; reigned as Louis II), Duke of Lucca( 1824 \u2013 1847; reigned as Charles I), and Duke of Parma( 1847 \u2013 1849; reigned as Charles II). He was the only son of Louis, Prince of Piacenza, and his wife Infanta Maria Luisa of Spain. Born at the Royal Palace of Madrid at the court of his maternal grandfather King Charles IV of Spain, he spent his first years living at the Spanish court. In 1801, by the Treaty of Aranjuez, Charles became Crown Prince of Etruria, a newly created kingdom formed from territories of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany. Charles moved to Italy with his parents and in 1803, not yet four years old, he succeeded his father as King of Etruria under the name Charles Louis I. His mother Infanta Maria Luisa assumed the regency while Charles Louis' minority lasted. In 1807 Napoleon Bonaparte dissolved the kingdom of Etruria and Charles Louis and his mother took refuge in Spain. In May 1808 they were forced to leave Spain by Napoleon who arrested Charles Louis' mother in a convent in Rome. Between 1811 and 1814 Charles Louis was placed under the care of his grandfather, the deposed King Charles IV of Spain. After Napoleon's fall, in 1817, Infanta Maria Luisa became Duchess of Lucca in her own right and Charles Louis, age sixteen, became hereditary Prince of Lucca. In 1820 he married Princess Maria Teresa of Savoy. They were a mismatched couple and had only one surviving son. At his mother's death in 1824, Charles Louis became the reigning Duke of Lucca as Charles I. He had little interest in ruling. He left the duchy in the hands of his ministers and spent most of his time traveling around Europe. A liberal movement led him to abdicate Lucca in favor of the Grand Duke of Tuscany in October 1847 in exchange for financial compensation, as he wanted to retire to private life. Two months later, in December 1847, at the death of the former Empress Marie Louise, he succeeded her as the reigning Duke of Parma according to what had been stipulated by the Congress of Vienna. His reign in Parma as Duke Charles II was brief. He was ill- received by his new subjects and within a few months he was ousted by a revolution. He regained control of Parma under the protection of Austrian troops, but finally abdicated in favor of his son Charles III on 14 March 1849. His son was assassinated in 1854 and his grandson Robert I, the last reigning Duke of Parma, was deposed in 1860. In exile Charles Louis assumed the title of count of Villafranca.

Matthew was married to Charlotte Blackman in 1822, and they originally lived on a small estate in Yapton, but were not known to have had any children. Matthew received his hyphenated surname and family coat of arms in 1842 by Royal Licence obtained by his brother, Edward Howard- Gibbon, with consent of the 13th Duke of Norfolk. He was appointed by the Duke of Norfolk to the office of Richmond Herald of Arms in Ordinary at the College of Arms in 1846. In 1869, he was noted as the last member of the College to actually reside there during his long tenure in that position.

He was born Edward Howard Gibbon in London and was the second son of the Charles Howard, 11th Duke of Norfolk, and Mary Ann Gibbon\u2014the Duke's longtime mistress. Edward received a formal education, became a surgeon in his early adult years, and then pursued legal training. He and his family migrated to British Guiana to serve as \"Protector of the Slaves\" before returning to England. He established himself as an officer of arms at the College of Arms. He served as both York Herald of Arms in Ordinary and Norroy King of Arms. Edward received his hyphenated surname and family coat of arms in 1842 by Royal Licence with consent of the 13th Duke of Norfolk. He served as the mayor of Arundel during the time of Queen Victoria's official visit in 1846. He died on 22 June 1849 in London and is buried at Saint Nicholas Churchyard in Arundel. He was survived by his wife Amelia Dendy Howard-Gibbon and six children. His oldest daughter, Amelia Frances Howard-Gibbon, later became a well-known artist in Ontario, Canada, and the annual Canadian children's illustration award is named for her. Charles Howard, 11th Duke of Norfolk (15 March 1746 \u2013 16 December 1815), styled Earl of Surrey from 1777 to 1786, was a British nobleman, peer, and politician. He was the son of Charles Howard, 10th Duke of Norfolk and Catherine Brockholes. Howard was known for actively participating in the Tory party as part of the support for King George III. He also spent a considerable amount of his money rebuilding and refurbishing Arundel Castle after inheriting his title and lands. Amelia Frances Howard- Gibbon( 24 July 1826 \u2013 6 February 1874) was a teacher and artist known for her talents during the 1860s in Ontario, Canada. In 1966, her most comprehensive work,\" An Illustrated Comic Alphabet\", was published by librarians and artists who admired her work. Five years later, the Canadian Library Association inaugurated an annual award named for her, Amelia Frances Howard- Gibbon Illustrator's Award. It recognizes the year's best illustration by a Canadian illustrator of a children's book published in Canada. Born at Littlehampton, Sussex, England, she was the oldest daughter of Amelia Dendy and Edward Howard Howard- Gibbon, himself the illegitimate son of Charles Howard, 11th Duke of Norfolk. She was educated in private schools during the employment of her father at the College of Arms. From her earliest years, Howard- Gibbon enjoyed drawing freehanded sketches, some of which survive today. She is believed to have studied French, German, and Art while in Paris, France, and Stuttgart, Germany. She was the first of the Howard- Gibbon siblings to emigrate to Ontario, where she began teaching in St. Thomas. She later moved to Sarnia and continued to teach children there for many years. Howard- Gibbon moved back to England in 1873, to claim an inheritance from her uncle Matthew Charles Howard- Gibbon, and became ill. She died in Lambeth and was buried with her father at Saint Nicholas Churchyard in Arundel. During Howard- Gibbon's time in Ontario, she created watercolor portraits and sketches of several friends and family members. In 1859 she sketched a children's alphabet book which she later gave to a friend, Martha Poussette. Many years later Poussette's family donated the book to the Toronto Children's Library.

She was purportedly married to him by a Catholic priest about 1796, while the Duke's second wife was still living but residing in an insane asylum since 1772. Gibbon lived at Norfolk House in London for most of this time, but is believed to have also travelled with the Duke to Arundel Castle during his stays there. She was the mother of five of children by Duke Charles, Matthew Charles Howard- Gibbon, Edward Howard Howard- Gibbon, Mary Eliza Howard- Gibbon, Caroline Howard- Gibbon, and Richard Howard- Gibbon.

Alexander Mair\" Sandy\" Courage Jr.( December 10, 1919 May 15, 2008) was an American orchestrator, arranger, and composer of music, primarily for television and film. He is best known as the composer of the theme music for the original\" Star Trek\" series. Alexandru Cristea( 1890 \u2013 1942) was the composer of the music for\" Limba Noastr\u0103\", current national anthem of Moldova. Alonso Mudarra( c. 1510 \u2013 April 1, 1580) was a Spanish composer of the Renaissance, and also played the vihuela, a guitar- shaped string instrument. He was an innovative composer of instrumental music as well as songs, and was the composer of the earliest surviving music for the guitar. Robert Leroy Johnson (May 8, 1911August 16, 1938) was an American blues singer, songwriter and musician. His landmark recordings in 1936 and 1937 display a combination of singing, guitar skills, and songwriting talent that has influenced later generations of musicians. Johnson's poorly documented life and death have given rise to much legend. The one most closely associated with his life is that he sold his soul to the devil at a local crossroads to achieve musical success. He is now recognized as a master of the blues, particularly as a progenitor of the Delta blues style. As an itinerant performer who played mostly on street corners, in juke joints, and at Saturday night dances, Johnson had little commercial success or public recognition in his lifetime. He participated in only two recording sessions, one in San Antonio in 1936, and one in Dallas in 1937, that produced 29 distinct songs (with 13 surviving alternate takes) recorded by famed Country Music Hall of Fame producer Don Law. These songs, recorded at low fidelity in improvised studios, were the totality of his recorded output. Most were released as 10-inch, 78 rpm singles from , with a few released after his death. Other than these recordings, very little was known of him during his life outside of the small musical circuit in the Mississippi Delta where he spent most of his life; much of his story has been reconstructed after his death by researchers. His music had a small, but influential, following during his life and in the two decades after his death. In late 1938 John Hammond sought him out for a concert at Carnegie Hall, \"From Spirituals to Swing\", only to discover that Johnson had died. Brunswick Records, which owned the original recordings, was bought by Columbia Records, where Hammond was employed. Musicologist Alan Lomax went to Mississippi in 1941 to record Johnson, also not knowing of his death. Law, who by then worked for Columbia Records, assembled a collection of Johnson's recordings titled \"King of the Delta Blues Singers\" that was released by Columbia in 1961. It is widely credited with finally bringing Johnson's work to a wider audience. The album would become influential, especially on the nascent British blues movement which was just getting started at the time; Eric Clapton has called Johnson \"the most important blues singer that ever lived. \" Musicians such as Bob Dylan, Keith Richards, and Robert Plant have cited both Johnson's lyricism and musicianship as key influences on their own work. Many of Johnson's songs have been covered over the years, becoming hits for other artists, and his guitar licks and lyrics have been borrowed and re-purposed by many later musicians. Renewed interest in Johnson's work and life led to a burst of scholarship starting in the 1960s. Much of what is known about him today was reconstructed by researchers such as Gayle Dean Wardlow. Two films, the 1991 documentary \"The Search for Robert Johnson\" by John Hammond, Jr., and a 1997 documentary, \" Can't You Hear the Wind Howl, the Life and Music of Robert Johnson,\" which included reconstructed scenes with Keb' Mo' as Johnson, were both attempts to document his life, and demonstrated the difficulties arising from the scant historical record and conflicting oral accounts. Johnson was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in its first induction ceremony, in 1986, as an early influence on rock and roll. He was awarded a posthumous Grammy Award in 1991 for \"The Complete Recordings\", a 1990 compilation album. His single \"Cross Road Blues\" was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1998, and he was given a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2006. In 2003, David Fricke ranked Johnson fifth in \"Rolling Stone\" magazine's \"100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\". Walter Robinson is an African American composer of the late 20th century. He is most notable for his 1977 song\" Harriet Tubman\", which has been recorded by folk musicians such as Holly Near, John McCutcheon, and others. He is also the composer of several operas. Petrus de Domarto( fl. c. 1445\u2013 1455) was a Franco- Flemish composer of the Renaissance.

{"question": "You are an expert in multi-hop question answering. You will be given several paragraphs as context.  \nPlease carefully read all the information and answer the question using reasoning across the paragraphs.  \nProvide the answer directly without adding any explanation.\n\nContext:\nIgor Zakharovich Bondarevsky  (May 12, 1913 in Rostov-on-the-Don, Russia \u2013 June 14, 1979 in Pyatigorsk, Soviet Union) was a Soviet Russian chess Grandmaster in both over-the-board and correspondence chess, an International Arbiter, trainer, and chess author. Bondarevsky shared the 1940 Soviet title, and later coached World Champion Boris Spassky. The place of birth( POB) or birthplace is the place where a person was born. This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has\" sovereignty\" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" f\u00f6delsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively). A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\". Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\"). There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country). Some administrative forms may request the applicant's\" country of birth\". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\". For US citizens born abroad who under the US Constitution acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA( American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place.

You will be given several paragraphs as context.  \nPlease carefully read all the information and answer the question using reasoning across the paragraphs.  \nProvide the answer directly without adding any explanation.\n\nContext:\n\"You Left the Water Running\" is a soul music song written by Dan Penn, Rick Hall, and Oscar Franks which has been recorded by many artists, including Wilson Pickett, Barbara Lynn, Don Varner (1967), Billy Young, Maurice & Mac, Amazing Rhythm Aces, Bobby Hatfield, James & Bobby Purify, and Otis Redding. Redding's connection to the song is documented by music journalist Dave Marsh in his 1989 book \"The Heart of Rock and Soul\". In 1966, Redding was visiting FAME Studios in Muscle Shoals, Alabama, when studio owner Rick Hall requested Redding help them with an upcoming session. Wilson Pickett was to record \" You Left the Water Running\", and Hall wished for Redding to record a demo to assist with the production. A simple recording was made and Redding made some overdub additions, and Pickett made his recording similar to Redding's version. Ten years later, Marsh was mailed a promo copy of \"You Left the Water Running\" by Redding on Stone Records (the flipside was an instrumental called \"The Otis Jam\", which was produced by John Fred, of \"Judy in Disguise (with Glasses)\" fame). Marsh was fascinated by the song, and mentioned the new single to several friends, including his attorney, who also happened to represent the Redding estate. He soon found out that Stone Records had not obtained the Redding family's permission to release the long-lost demo recording, and demanded the single be pulled from circulation. When Marsh asked the label's distributor what was to become of the single, he was informed that they were to be destroyed. Instead, Marsh purchased the copies that remained, and gave them out as gifts, with the attorney's permission. As a result, the single (Stone 209) is now highly valuable. Atlantic Records released \"You Left the Water Running\" for the first time legally on the compilation album \"The Otis Redding Story\" in 1987. Though that box set is no longer available, the song has appeared in similar collections in the years that have followed. \" O Valencia!\" is the fifth single by the indie rock band The Decemberists, and the first released from their fourth studio album,\" The Crane Wife\". The music was written by The Decemberists and the lyrics by Colin Meloy. It tells a story of two star- crossed lovers. The singer falls in love with a person who belongs to an opposing gang. At the end of the song, the singer's lover jumps in to defend the singer, who is confronting his lover's brother( the singer's\" sworn enemy\") and is killed by the bullet intended for the singer.

Otis Ray Redding Jr. (September 9, 1941 \u2013 December 10, 1967) was an American singer, songwriter, record producer, arranger, and talent scout. He is considered one of the greatest singers in the history of American popular music and a seminal artist in soul music and rhythm and blues. Redding's style of singing gained inspiration from the gospel music that preceded the genre. His singing style influenced many other soul artists of the 1960s. Redding was born in Dawson, Georgia, and at the age of 2, moved to Macon, Georgia. Redding quit school at age 15 to support his family, working with Little Richard's backing band, the Upsetters, and by performing in talent shows at the historic Douglass Theatre in Macon. In 1958, he joined Johnny Jenkins's band, the Pinetoppers, with whom he toured the Southern states as a singer and driver. An unscheduled appearance on a Stax recording session led to a contract and his first single, \"These Arms of Mine\", in 1962. Stax released Redding's debut album, \"Pain in My Heart\", two years later. Initially popular mainly with African-Americans, Redding later reached a wider American pop music audience. Along with his group, he first played small shows in the American South.

Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria (1 December 19492 December 1993) was a Colombian drug lord and narcoterrorist who founded and was the sole leader of the Medell\u00edn Cartel. Dubbed \"The King of Cocaine\", Escobar is the wealthiest criminal in history, having amassed an estimated net worth of US$30 billion by the time of his death\u2014equivalent to $ billion as of \u2014while his drug cartel monopolized the cocaine trade into the United States in the 1980s and 1990s. Born in Rionegro and raised in Medell\u00edn, Escobar studied briefly at Universidad Aut\u00f3noma Latinoamericana of Medell\u00edn, but left without graduating; he instead began engaging in criminal activity, selling illegal cigarettes and fake lottery tickets, as well as participating in motor vehicle theft. In the early 1970s, he began to work for various drug smugglers, often kidnapping and holding people for ransom. In 1976, Escobar founded the Medell\u00edn Cartel, which distributed powder cocaine, and established the first smuggling routes into the United States. Escobar's infiltration into the U.S. created exponential demand for cocaine, and by the 1980s, it was estimated Escobar led monthly shipments of 70 to 80 tons of cocaine into the country from Colombia. As a result, Escobar quickly became one of the richest people in the world, but consistently battled rival cartels domestically and abroad, leading to massacres and the murders of police officers, judges, locals, and prominent politicians, making Colombia the murder capital of the world. In the 1982 parliamentary election, Escobar was elected as an alternate member of the Chamber of Representatives as part of the Liberal Alternative movement. Through this, he was responsible for community projects, such as the construction of houses and football fields, which gained him popularity among the locals of the towns that he frequented. However, Escobar was vilified by the Colombian and U.S. governments, who routinely stifled his political ambitions and pushed for his arrest, with Escobar widely believed to have orchestrated the DAS Building bombing and Avianca Flight 203 bombings in retaliation. In 1991, Escobar surrendered to authorities, and was sentenced to five years' imprisonment on a host of charges, but struck a deal of no extradition with Colombian President Cesar Gaviria, with the ability of being housed in his own, self-built prison, La Catedral. In 1992, Escobar escaped and went into hiding when authorities attempted to move him to a more standard holding facility, leading to a nation-wide manhunt. As a result, the Medell\u00edn Cartel crumbled, and in 1993, Escobar was killed in his hometown by Colombian National Police, a day after his 44th birthday. His legacy remains controversial; while many denounce the heinous nature of his crimes, Escobar was seen as a \"Robin Hood-like\" figure for many in Colombia, as he provided many amenities to the poor, while his killing was mourned and his funeral attended by over 25,000 people.

Hitchcock caught Hollywood's attention with the film and relocated to Hollywood soon after its release. Although the director's three previous efforts had done poorly at the box office,\" The Lady Vanishes\" was widely successful, and confirmed American producer David O. Selznick's belief that Hitchcock indeed had a future in Hollywood cinema. The British Film Institute ranked\" The Lady Vanishes\" the 35th best British film of the 20th century. In 2017 a poll of 150 actors, directors, writers, producers and critics for\" Time Out\" magazine saw it ranked the 31st best British film ever. Having remained one of Hitchcock's most renowned British films, a remake( also titled\" The Lady Vanishes\") was released in 1979, and in March 2013 the BBC broadcast a TV adaptation starring Tuppence Middleton as Iris. Bill Kenwright has adapted the 1938 film to a stage version which will be on a national tour in 2019. The play stars husband and wife Juliet Mills and Maxwell Caulfield and Lorna Fitzgerald. Sir Alfred Joseph Hitchcock,( 13 August 1899 \u2013 29 April 1980) was an English film director and producer, widely regarded as one of the most influential and extensively studied filmmakers in the history of cinema. Known as\" the Master of Suspense\", he directed over 50 feature films in a career spanning six decades, becoming as well known as any of his actors thanks to his many interviews, his cameo roles in most of his films, and his hosting and producing of the television anthology\" Alfred Hitchcock Presents\"( 1955 \u2013 1965). His films garnered a total of 46 Oscar nominations and six wins. Born in Leytonstone, Essex, Hitchcock entered the film industry in 1919 as a title card designer after training as a technical clerk and copy writer for a telegraph- cable company. He made his directorial debut with the silent film\" The Pleasure Garden\"( 1925). His first successful film,( 1927), helped to shape the thriller genre, while his 1929 film,\" Blackmail\", was the first British. Two of his 1930s thrillers,\" The 39 Steps\"( 1935) and\" The Lady Vanishes\"( 1938), are ranked among the greatest British films of the 20th century. By 1939 Hitchcock was a filmmaker of international importance, and film producer David O. Selznick persuaded him to move to Hollywood. A string of successful films followed, including\" Rebecca\"( 1940),\" Foreign Correspondent\"( 1940),\" Suspicion\"( 1941),\" Shadow of a Doubt\"( 1943), and\" Notorious\"( 1946). \" Rebecca\" won the Academy Award for Best Picture, although Hitchcock himself was only nominated as Best Director; he was also nominated for\" Lifeboat\"( 1944) and\" Spellbound\"( 1945), although he never won the Best Director Academy Award. The\" Hitchcockian\" style includes the use of camera movement to mimic a person's gaze, thereby turning viewers into voyeurs, and framing shots to maximise anxiety and fear. The film critic Robin Wood wrote that the meaning of a Hitchcock film\" is there in the method, in the progression from shot to shot. A Hitchcock film is an organism, with the whole implied in every detail and every detail related to the whole.\" After a brief lull of commercial success in the late 1940s, Hitchcock returned to form with\" Strangers on a Train\"( 1951) and\" Dial M For Murder\"( 1954). By 1960 Hitchcock had directed four films often ranked among the greatest of all time:\" Rear Window\"( 1954),\" Vertigo\"( 1958),\" North by Northwest\"( 1959), and\" Psycho\"( 1960) with the first and last of these garnering him Best Director nominations. In 2012,\" Vertigo\" replaced Orson Welles's\" Citizen Kane\"( 1941) as the British Film Institute's greatest film ever made based on its world- wide poll of hundreds of film critics. By 2018 eight of his films had been selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry, including his personal favourite,\" Shadow of a Doubt\"( 1943). He received the BAFTA Fellowship in 1971, the AFI Life Achievement Award in 1979 and was knighted in December that year, four months before he died.

She was praised for her contralto vocals, and her drumming abilities were viewed positively by other musicians and critics. Her struggles with eating disorders would later raise awareness of anorexia and body dysmorphia. Carpenter was born in New Haven, Connecticut, and moved to Downey, California, in 1963 with her family. She began to study the drums in high school and joined the Long Beach State choir after graduating. After several years of touring and recording, the Carpenters were signed to A&M Records in 1969, achieving commercial and critical success throughout the 1970s. Initially, Carpenter was the band's full-time drummer, but gradually took the role of frontwoman as drumming was reduced to a handful of live showcases or tracks on albums. While the Carpenters were on hiatus in the late 1970s, she recorded a solo album, which was released years after her death. Carpenter suffered from anorexia nervosa, which was little-known at the time, and was briefly married in the early 1980s. She died at age 32 from heart failure caused by complications related to her illness. Her death led to increased visibility and awareness of eating disorders.

This process led Magic Lamp to defunct, but the song, along with its B-side \" I'll Be Yours\", were later included on the 1991 4-CD box set \"From the Top\". According to the liner notes for the album From The Top, the master tapes for this recording and its flip side were lost in a fire at Joe Osborn's house in 1974.

He was considered the \"de facto\" leader (1926\u201335) of the Second Polish Republic as the Minister of Military Affairs. After World War I he held great power in Polish politics and was a distinguished figure on the international scene. He is viewed as a father of the Second Polish Republic re-established in 1918, 123 years after the final Partition of Poland by Austria, Prussia and Russia in 1795. Deeming himself a descendant of the culture and traditions of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth, Pi\u0142sudski believed in a multi-ethnic Poland\u2014\"a home of nations\" including indigenous ethnic and religious minorities that he hoped would establish a robust union with the independent states of Lithuania and Ukraine. His principal political antagonist, Roman Dmowski, leader of the National Democrat party, by contrast, called for a Poland limited to the pre-Partitions Polish Crown and based mainly on a homogeneous ethnically Polish population and Roman Catholic identity. Early in his political career, Pi\u0142sudski became a leader of the Polish Socialist Party. Concluding that Poland's independence would have to be won militarily, he formed the Polish Legions. In 1914 he correctly predicted that a new major war would defeat the Russian Empire and the Central Powers. When World War I began in 1914, Pi\u0142sudski's Legions fought alongside Austria-Hungary against Russia. In 1917, with Imperialist Russia faring poorly in the war, he withdrew his support for the Central Powers and was imprisoned in Magdeburg by the Germans. From November 1918, when Poland regained its independence, until 1922, Pi\u0142sudski was Poland's Chief of State. In 1919\u201321 he commanded Polish forces in six border wars that re-defined the country's borders. On the verge of defeat in the Polish\u2013Soviet War his forces, in the August 1920 Battle of Warsaw, threw back the invading Soviet Russians. In 1923, with the government dominated by his opponents, in particular the National Democrats, Pi\u0142sudski retired from active politics. Three years later he returned to power in the May 1926 \"coup d'\u00e9tat\" and became Poland's strongman. From then on until his death in 1935, he concerned himself primarily with military and foreign affairs. It was during this period that he developed a cult of personality that has survived into the 21st century. In international affairs, Pi\u0142sudski pursued two complementary strategies meant to secure Poland's independence and to enhance national security: \"Prometheism\", aimed at achieving the disintegration of Imperial Russia and later the Soviet Union into their constituent nations; and the creation of an Intermarium federation of Central and Eastern European states lying between the Baltic and Black Seas, to secure its peoples against Western and Eastern European imperialisms. Historian Piotr Wandycz characterizes Pi\u0142sudski as \"an ardent Polish patriot who on occasion would castigate the Poles for their stupidity, cowardice, or servility. He described himself as a Polish-Lithuanian, and was stubborn and reserved, loath to show his emotions. \" Some aspects of Pi\u0142sudski's administration, such as establishing Bereza Kartuska prison, described by many as a concentration camp, remain controversial. Yet he is highly esteemed in Polish memory and is regarded, together with his chief antagonist Roman Dmowski, as a founder of the modern independent Poland.

{"question": "You are an expert in multi-hop question answering. You will be given several paragraphs as context.  \nPlease carefully read all the information and answer the question using reasoning across the paragraphs.  \nProvide the answer directly without adding any explanation.\n\nContext:\nIn numerical analysis, the quasi-Monte Carlo method is a method for numerical integration and solving some other problems using low-discrepancy sequences (also called quasi-random sequences or sub-random sequences). This is in contrast to the regular Monte Carlo method or Monte Carlo integration, which are based on sequences of pseudorandom numbers. Monte Carlo and quasi-Monte Carlo methods are stated in a similar way. The problem is to approximate the integral of a function \"f\" as the average of the function evaluated at a set of points \"xx\":\nSince we are integrating over the \"s\"-dimensional unit cube, each \"x\" is a vector of \"s\" elements. The difference between quasi-Monte Carlo and Monte Carlo is the way the x are chosen. Quasi-Monte Carlo uses a low-discrepancy sequence such as the Halton sequence, the Sobol sequence, or the Faure sequence, whereas Monte Carlo uses a pseudorandom sequence. The advantage of using low-discrepancy sequences is a faster rate of convergence. Quasi-Monte Carlo has a rate of convergence close to O(1/\"N\"), whereas the rate for the Monte Carlo method is O(\"N\"). The Quasi-Monte Carlo method recently became popular in the area of mathematical finance or computational finance. In these areas, high-dimensional numerical integrals, where the integral should be evaluated within a threshold \u03b5, occur frequently. Hence, the Monte Carlo method and the quasi-Monte Carlo method are beneficial in these situations. Monte Carlo( or colloquially\" Monte- Carl\") is officially an administrative area of the Principality of Monaco, specifically the ward of Monte Carlo/ Sp\u00e9lugues, where the Monte Carlo Casino is located. Informally, the name also refers to a larger district, the Monte Carlo Quarter( corresponding to the former municipality of Monte Carlo), which besides Monte Carlo/ Sp\u00e9lugues also includes the wards of La Rousse/ Saint Roman, Larvotto/ Bas Moulins, and Saint Michel. The permanent population of the ward of Monte Carlo is about 3,500, while that of the quarter is about 15,000. Monaco has four traditional quarters. From west to east they are: Fontvieille( the newest), Monaco- Ville( the oldest), La Condamine, and Monte Carlo. Monte Carlo is situated on a prominent escarpment at the base of the Maritime Alps along the French Riviera. Near the quarter's western end is the world- famous Place du Casino, the gambling center which has made Monte Carlo\" an international byword for the extravagant display and reckless dispersal of wealth\". It is also the location of the H\u00f4tel de Paris, Caf\u00e9 de Paris and Salle Garnier( the casino theatre which is the home of the Op\u00e9ra de Monte- Carlo). The quarter's eastern part includes the community of Larvotto with Monaco's only public beach, as well as its new convention center( the Grimaldi Forum), and the Monte- Carlo Bay Hotel& Resort. At the quarter's eastern border, one crosses into the French town of Beausoleil( sometimes referred to as Monte- Carlo- Sup\u00e9rieur), and just to its east is the western border of Italy.

Etan Boritzer( born 1950) is an American writer of children \u2019s literature who is best known for his book\" What is God?\" first published in 1989. His best selling\" What is?\" illustrated children's book series on character education and difficult subjects for children is a popular teaching guide for parents, teachers and child- life professionals. Boritzer gained national critical acclaim after\" What is God?\" was published in 1989 although the book has caused controversy from religious fundamentalists for its universalist views. The other current books in the\" What is?\" series include What is Love?, What is Death?, What is Beautiful?, What is Funny?, What is Right?, What is Peace?, What is Money?, What is Dreaming?, What is a Friend?, What is True?, What is a Family?, What is a Feeling?\" The series is now also translated into 15 languages. Boritzer was first published in 1963 at the age of 13 when he wrote an essay in his English class at Wade Junior High School in the Bronx, New York on the assassination of John F. Kennedy. His essay was included in a special anthology by New York City public school children compiled and published by the New York City Department of Education. Boritzer now lives in Venice, California and maintains his publishing office there also. He has helped numerous other authors to get published through\" How to Get Your Book Published!\" programs. Boritzer is also a yoga teacher who teaches regular classes locally and guest- teaches nationally. He is also recognized nationally as an erudite speaker on\" The Teachings of the Buddha.\" Theodred II was a medieval Bishop of Elmham. The date of Theodred's consecration unknown, but the date of his death was sometime between 995 and 997. The place of birth( POB) or birthplace is the place where a person was born. This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has\" sovereignty\" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" f\u00f6delsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively). A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\". Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\"). There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country). Some administrative forms may request the applicant's\" country of birth\". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\". For US citizens born abroad who under the US Constitution acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA( American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place.\n\nQuestion:\nWhen is the director of film Monte Carlo Nights 's birthday?\n\nPlease give the answer directly without any explanation.", "results": "October 12, 1881", "reasoning_chains": []}

Hiram \"Hank\" Williams (September 17, 1923 \u2013 January 1, 1953) was an American singer-songwriter and musician. Regarded as one of the most significant and influential American singers and songwriters of the 20th century, Williams recorded 35 singles (five released posthumously) that reached the Top 10 of the \"Billboard\" Country & Western Best Sellers chart, including 11 that ranked number one (three posthumously). Born in Mount Olive, Butler County, Alabama, Williams relocated to Georgiana with his family, where he met Rufus Payne, an African American blues musician, who gave him guitar lessons in exchange for meals or money. Payne had a major influence on Williams' later musical style, along with Roy Acuff and Ernest Tubb. Williams would later relocate to Montgomery, where he began his music career in 1937, when producers at radio station WSFA hired him to perform and host a 15-minute program. He formed the Drifting Cowboys backup band, which was managed by his mother, and dropped out of school to devote his time to his career. When several of his band members were conscripted into military service during World War II, Williams had trouble with their replacements, and WSFA terminated his contract because of his alcohol abuse. Williams eventually married Audrey Sheppard, who was his manager for nearly a decade. After recording \"Never Again\" and \"Honky Tonkin'\" with Sterling Records, he signed a contract with MGM Records. In 1947, he released \"Move It on Over\", which became a hit, and also joined the \"Louisiana Hayride\" radio program. One year later, he released a cover of \"Lovesick Blues\" recorded at Herzog Studio in Cincinnati, which carried him into the mainstream of music. After an initial rejection, Williams joined the Grand Ole Opry. He was unable to read or notate music to any significant degree. Among the hits he wrote were \"Your Cheatin' HeartHey, Good Lookin'\", and \"I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry\". Years of back pain, alcoholism and prescription drug abuse severely compromised his health. In 1952 he divorced Sheppard and was dismissed by the Grand Ole Opry because of his unreliability and alcohol abuse. On New Year's Day 1953, he died suddenly while traveling to a concert in Canton, Ohio, at the age of 29. Despite his short life, Williams is one of the most celebrated and influential popular musicians of the 20th century, especially in regard to country music. Many artists covered songs Williams wrote and recorded. He influenced Elvis Presley, Johnny Cash, Chuck Berry, Jerry Lee Lewis, Bob Dylan, George Jones, Charley Pride, and The Rolling Stones, among others. Williams was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame (1961), the Songwriters Hall of Fame (1970), and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (1987). The Pulitzer Prize jury in 2010 awarded him a posthumous special citation \"for his craftsmanship as a songwriter who expressed universal feelings with poignant simplicity and played a pivotal role in transforming country music into a major musical and cultural force in American life.\" Bernard Bonvoisin, known as Bernie Bonvoisin( born 9 July 1956 in Nanterre, Hauts- de- Seine), is a French hard rock singer and film director.

It was entered into the 5th Moscow International Film Festival. Risto Antero Jarva( 15 July 1934, Helsinki \u2013 16 December 1977, Helsinki) was a Finnish filmmaker. His last film was\" J\u00e4niksen vuosi The Year of the Hare\"). He died in a car accident on his way back from a private showing of the film, and the subsequent party. Jarva usually approached his long films and short documentary films from some social problem and from one or more possible ways to solve it. Such problems included the widespread use of cars, the position of women, city planning, pollution, the role of gossip magazines' journalists, and the Finnish society's remaining ideological divides. His 1967 film\" The Diary of a Worker\" was entered into the 5th Moscow International Film Festival.

In a similar fashion to the diary of Thomas Turner, Holland's diary is a personal consideration of the workings of country life during a time of considerable national tension. The diary is broad in scope, with limited discussion of national events such as the Napoleonic Wars occurring alongside treatment of local matters. Not all of the diary's original 99 volumes survive; particularly, entries written both before and after the current known time- span of the diary are thought to have existed.

John Smith( 1799 \u2013 3 March 1870) was the Rector of St Mary's church in Baldock in Hertfordshire and is noted for being the first person to transcribe the Diary of Samuel Pepys. Smith was the first to decipher the complete text of the Diary of Samuel Pepys while a student at Magdalene College, Cambridge where the Diary is kept( others had previously deciphered sections of it). Smith laboured on the Diaries for three years, from 1819 to 1822, and had assumed that they were written in code. He broke the code by comparing the section in the Diary concerning the escape of Charles II from Worcester Castle with the longhand version of the same event Pepys published later. Later Smith was told that the diary was actually written in a shorthand system devised by Thomas Skelton and that the textbook Pepys learnt it from was on the bookshelf above Smith's head. Smith's transcription, which is kept in the Pepys Library, was the basis for the first published edition of the diary, edited by Lord Braybrooke, released in two volumes in 1825. Smith also worked on other material by Pepys, transcribing the so- called\" Tangier Diary\" of 1683 in the Bodleian Library.

Brian Saunders( date of birth and death unknown) was a male weightlifter who competed for England. Les Richards( date of birth unknown) was an Australian rules footballer who played with North Melbourne in the Victorian Football League( VFL). Mark Kenneth Woods( date of birth unknown) is a Canadian comedy writer, actor, producer, director and TV host. Pamela Jain is an Indian playback singer. Date of Birth:16th March. The place of birth( POB) or birthplace is the place where a person was born. This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has\" sovereignty\" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" f\u00f6delsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively). A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\". Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\"). There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country). Some administrative forms may request the applicant's\" country of birth\". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\". For US citizens born abroad who under the US Constitution acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA( American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place.

Louis Daniel Armstrong (August 4, 1901 \u2013 July 6, 1971), nicknamed Satchmo, Satch, and Pops, was an American trumpeter, composer, vocalist, and actor who was among the most influential figures in jazz. His career spanned five decades, from the 1920s to the 1960s, and different eras in the history of jazz. In 2017, he was inducted into the Rhythm & Blues Hall of Fame. Armstrong was born and raised in New Orleans. Coming to prominence in the 1920s as an inventive trumpet and cornet player, Armstrong was a foundational influence in jazz, shifting the focus of the music from collective improvisation to solo performance. Around 1922, he followed his mentor, Joe \"King\" Oliver, to Chicago to play in the Creole Jazz Band. In Chicago, he spent time with other popular jazz musicians, reconnecting with his friend Bix Beiderbecke and spending time with Hoagy Carmichael and Lil Hardin. He earned a reputation at \"cutting contests\", and relocated to New York in order to join Fletcher Henderson's band. With his instantly recognizable rich, gravelly voice, Armstrong was also an influential singer and skillful improviser, bending the lyrics and melody of a song. He was also skilled at scat singing. Armstrong is renowned for his charismatic stage presence and voice as well as his trumpet playing. By the end of Armstrong's career in the 1960s, his influence had spread to popular music in general. Armstrong was one of the first popular African-American entertainers to \"cross over\", meaning his music transcended his skin color in a racially divided America. He rarely publicly politicized his race, to the dismay of fellow African Americans, but took a well-publicized stand for desegregation in the Little Rock crisis. He was able to access the upper echelons of American society at a time when this was difficult for black men. Billy Milano is a Bronx- born heavy metal musician now based in Austin, Texas.

Marshall Eugene Cornett (November 22, 1898 - October 28, 1947) was an Oregon businessman and American Republican politician serving in the Oregon State Senate and as Senate President during the 1947 legislative session. Along with Governor of Oregon Earl Snell and Oregon Secretary of State Robert S. Farrell, Jr., he was killed in a plane crash in 1947. Marshall Eugene DeWolfe (September 22, 1880 \u2013 January 1, 1915) was the only child of future First Lady Florence Harding (then, Florence Kling) and her first husband, Henry Athenton \"Pete\" DeWolfe (March 4, 1859 \u2013 March 8, 1894). Born in Galion, Crawford County, Ohio, young DeWolfe was primarily raised by his mother; his father was a chronic alcoholic who was absent from the home for days at a time. Those doing research on the Hardings, including John Dean and Robert Ferrell among others, have never been able to find documentary proof of a regular marriage between Kling and DeWolfe, leading some people to conclude it was a common law marriage\u2014a form of irregular marriage contracted by habit and repute, which was not abolished in Ohio until 1991. The marriage between Kling and DeWolfe is otherwise attested by the papers from their divorce proceeding, which are on file in Marion County, Ohio. It is also possible that they had a regular marriage and the officiant who solemnized it simply failed to return the marriage certificate to the county, or the county clerk's office subsequently lost it. A record of the issuance of a marriage \"license\" was printed in \"The Marion Star\" on January 31, 1880; and the January 27, 1880 edition of the same paper refers to a marriage having occurred at Columbus on January 22, 1880. The documentary proof of a regular marriage is the marriage \"certificate\", which is completed by the solemnizing officiant and returned to the county clerk for recordation. The marriage certificate usually comprises the lower part of the same document as the marriage license, so if the certificate gets lost on its way to the county clerk the license will be lost along with it. Following the divorce of his parents, Marshall was raised by his grandparents, Amos Hall Kling and Louisa \"Louise\" Mabel (Bouton) Kling, while his mother lived independently and earned an income as a piano teacher in Marion, Ohio. As part of the agreement with her father, Florence would not have a role in her own son\u2019s upbringing. Throughout his life, Marshall used either his Kling or DeWolfe surname. Florence Kling DeWolfe married newspaper publisher Warren G. Harding in 1891. However, Marshall remained under his grandfather's control and roof. While a room was set aside for him in the Harding home, Marshall never felt at home under his mother's roof, and never comfortable under his grandfather's strict control. DeWolfe studied journalism at the University of Michigan from 1899 to 1903. While attending Michigan, he played football as a quarterback on the Michigan Wolverines all-freshman football team in 1899. DeWolfe aspired to be a newspaperman like his stepfather Warren G. Harding. By all accounts, his relationship with Harding was closer than the relationship that he had with his mother. After his graduation from Marion High School, DeWolfe was given a job at the \"Marion Daily Star\". DeWolfe eventually purchased a struggling newspaper in Colorado, moving there with his young family. The venture was unsuccessful, as was a later farming attempt, due in part to his alcoholism. DeWolfe died of the effects of alcoholism and tuberculosis in Colorado on January 1, 1915, at the age of 34. His death, the return of his body to Marion and his funeral were events that were not known in the community. He is buried in an unmarked grave in the DeWolfe family plot in Marion Cemetery. DeWolfe married Esther Naomi Neely. Their son, George Warren DeWolfe (1914\u20131968), and daughter, Eugenia DeWolfe (1911\u20131978), were the principal heirs to the estate left by their grandmother, Florence Harding, following her death on November 21, 1924. When Warren G. Harding ran for President in 1920, his wife skillfully bluffed reporters into believing that she had been a widow, not a divorcee, when they married. When she became First Lady, her ex-husband and son were forbidden topics at the White House and in the press. Florence Mabel Harding (\"n\u00e9e\" Kling; August 15, 1860 \u2013 November 21, 1924) was the First Lady of the United States from 1921 to 1923 as the wife of President Warren G. Harding. She married the somewhat-younger Harding when he was a newspaper publisher in Ohio, and she was acknowledged as the brains behind the business. Known as The Duchess, she adapted well to the White House, where she gave notably elegant parties. Iain William Provan( born 6 May 1957) is a British Old Testament scholar, now living in Canada.

As described in the film summary published in \"The New York Times\", the film \"follows Charles Cosby, a small time coke dealer in Oakland, California whose life is changed forever when he writes a fan letter to the \"Cocaine Godmother\" Griselda Blanco, who is serving time at a nearby federal prison. Six months later, Cosby is a multi-millionaire, Blanco's lover, and the head of her $40 million a year cocaine business.\" Although Blanco was imprisoned by the time Cosby met her, through Cosby and other intermediates, she was still able to organize a multi-million dollar cocaine empire, importing cocaine into California and distributing it to various locations across the United States. The relationship between Blanco and Cosby eventually came to an end when Jorge \"Rivi\" Ayala, Blanco's former hitman and enforcer, agreed to testify against her on the subject of several murders she had ordered. Blanco, facing a possible death sentence, attempted to organize the kidnapping of John F. Kennedy Jr., aiming to use him as a hostage to secure her release. Cosby claims to have balked at the prospect of engaging in such a serious crime with a lengthy sentence, preventing the kidnapping from taking place. Cosby himself was later subpoenaed to testify against Blanco, but the case against her collapsed when Rivi was implicated in a phone sex scandal with secretaries in the Florida State Attorney's office. Blanco was deported from the United States after her sentence was complete. The documentary also explores Blanco's criminal past, including her rise to prominence in the Miami drug trade, before her involvement in escalating criminal conflict in Miami, her relocation to California and eventual imprisonment.

Kazan writes, \"I don't move unless I have some empathy with the basic theme.\" His first such \"issue\" film was \"Gentleman's Agreement\" (1947), with Gregory Peck, which dealt with anti-Semitism in America. It received 8 Oscar nominations and 3 wins, including Kazan's first for Best Director. It was followed by \"Pinky\", one of the first films in mainstream Hollywood to address racial prejudice against African Americans. In 1954, he directed \"On the Waterfront\", a film about union corruption on the New York harbor waterfront. \" A Streetcar Named Desire\" (1951), an adaptation of the stage play which he had also directed, received 12 Oscar nominations, winning 4, and was Marlon Brando's breakthrough role. In 1955, he directed John Steinbeck's \"East of Eden\", which introduced James Dean to movie audiences. A turning point in Kazan's career came with his testimony as a witness before the House Committee on Un-American Activities in 1952 at the time of the Hollywood blacklist, which brought him strong negative reactions from many liberal friends and colleagues. His testimony helped end the careers of former acting colleagues Morris Carnovsky and Art Smith, along with the work of playwright Clifford Odets. The two men had made a pact to name each other in front of the committee. Kazan later justified his act by saying he took \"only the more tolerable of two alternatives that were either way painful and wrong. \" Nearly a half-century later, his anti-Communist testimony continued to cause controversy. When Kazan was awarded an honorary Oscar in 1999, dozens of actors chose not to applaud as 250 demonstrators picketed the event. Kazan influenced the films of the 1950s and 1960s with his provocative, issue-driven subjects. Director Stanley Kubrick called him, \"without question, the best director we have in America, [and] capable of performing miracles with the actors he uses. \" Film author Ian Freer concludes that even \"if his achievements are tainted by political controversy, the debt Hollywood\u2014and actors everywhere\u2014owes him is enormous. \" In 2010, Martin Scorsese co-directed the documentary film \"A Letter to Elia\" as a personal tribute to Kazan.

The Innocents is a 1961 British psychological horror film directed and produced by Jack Clayton, and starring Deborah Kerr, Michael Redgrave, and Megs Jenkins. Based on the novella\" The Turn of the Screw\" by the American novelist Henry James, the screenplay was adapted by William Archibald and Truman Capote, who used Archibald's own stage play\u2014also titled\" The Innocents\" \u2014as a primary source text. It s plot follows a governess who watches over two children and comes to fear that their large estate is haunted by ghosts and that the children are being possessed. Archibald's original screenplay for\" The Innocents\" was based on the premise that the paranormal events depicted were legitimate. Displeased with Archibald's take on the material, director Jack Clayton appointed American writer Truman Capote to rework the script. Capote's rewrites incorporated psychological themes, resulting in a final work that suggests other alternatives to the plot. Filming took place partly on location at the Gothic mansion of Sheffield Park in Sussex, with additional shoots occurring at Shepperton Studios in Surrey. Shot in CinemaScope,\" The Innocents\" incorporated bold minimal lighting as well as deep focus, employed by cinematographer Freddie Francis to achieve a distinctive\u2014and sometimes claustrophobic\u2014atmosphere.

It was released in the United States the following month on 15 December in Los Angeles and Christmas Day in New York City. The psychological underpinnings of the film's screenplay have resulted in it being the subject of numerous critical and scholarly essays, particularly in the area of film theory. Of the various film adaptations of James's work,\" The Innocents\" has received the most critical debate. It was selected by\" The Guardian\" as one of the 25 best horror films ever made.

With the United Kingdom at war,\" A Yank at Eton\" was filmed entirely in the United States. \" A Yank at Eton\" tells the tale of a cocky American youth( played by Rooney) who has to move to Britain, where he is sent to attend the elite Eton College. Lawford, in his first significant Hollywood role, plays an arrogant upperclassman who makes the newcomer's life particularly difficult. Much of the storyline relates to the misunderstandings arising from differences between the two countries' cultures, customs and language. At first these differences cause the boy confusion and anger, particularly against the traditional practices of fagging and physical hazing inflicted at Eton on the lower boys by the uppers. The film caricatures Etonian manners and behavior as snobbish and stuffy, but in due course Rooney's character settles down, stops being rebellious and comes to realize that, beneath the different habits and views,\" Yanks\" and\" Limeys\" have basic values in common and can get along when they have to. The propaganda intent, as U.S. troops poured into the U.K. to join World War II in 1942, was evidently to show that Americans and Britons could set aside their superficial differences and pull together in the war effort. The film has the Eton boating song as it s theme tune( played at a faster tempo than usual), though no boating is shown in the film. A Yank at Oxford (1938) is a British film directed by Jack Conway and starring Robert Taylor, Lionel Barrymore, Maureen O'Sullivan, Vivien Leigh and Edmund Gwenn. The screenplay was written by John Monk Saunders and Leon Gordon. The film was produced by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer British Studios at Denham Studios. \"A Yank at Oxford\" marks Vivien Leigh and Robert Taylor\u2019s first film appearance together; they would later appear as the romantic lead couple in the remake of \"Waterloo Bridge\" (1940). Before this film, Taylor was seen as the \"romantic love interest\" and thus as a 1930s equivalent to Rudolph Valentino, with men therefore starting to doubt Taylor's masculinity. His casting in this film (by Mayer) was a successful attempt to put paid to such doubts, and dramatically boosted his reputation with both men and women. Bachelor of Hearts is a 1958 British comedy film starring Hardy Kr\u00fcger as a German who studies at Cambridge University. It was made to cash in on Kr\u00fcger's popularity following the success of the war film,\" The One That Got Away\"( 1957). It combined elements of\" A Yank at Oxford\" with\" Doctor in the House\".

He has worked on over 100 films and television series since 1981, and is known for his work on such films as\" Dirty Dancing, Magnolia, There Will Be Blood\" and\" The Amazing Spider Man.\" Franz Antel( 28 June 1913 \u2013 11 August 2007) was a veteran Austrian filmmaker. Born in Vienna, Antel worked mainly as a film producer in the interwar years. After World War II, he began writing and directing films on a large scale. In the late 1940s, 1950s and 1960s these were mainly comedies( romantic, slapstick, and/ or musical) and\" K.u.k. films\" all of which, for Austrian and German TV stations alike, have been a staple of weekend afternoon programming ever since. In between there is quite a sober film about the Oberst( Colonel) Redl affair that shook the Austro- Hungarian Monarchy on the eve of World War I. Antel himself later commented on this period,\" I always wanted to provide good entertainment for the people at the cinema. After the screening, people should say: Well now, I am in a good mood, I will go out and have a glass of wine.\" ( German original:\" Ich wollte die Leute im Kino immer gut unterhalten. Die Besucher sollten nach der Filmvorf\u00fchrung sagen: So, jetzt bin ich gut aufgelegt, jetzt geh ich auf ein Viertel Wein.\") From the late 1960s, encouraged by the new opportunities in the film industry brought about by the sexual revolution, Antel gradually switched his main interest to soft porn and ribaldry. It was in particular his series of\" Frau Wirtinhostess\") films, directed under the pseudonym Fran\u00e7ois Legrand, with which he tried to win international recognition. Titles included\" The Sweet Sins of Sexy Susan\"( 1967),\" Sexy Susan Sins Again\"( 1968),\" Wild, Willing& Sexy\"( 1969) and\" Do n't Tell Daddy\"( aka\" Naughty Nymphs\" in the U.S.A.)( 1972). Antel would recount an anecdote about himself describing how, in order to live up to his reputation as a womanizer, he used to carry a pair of high heels in his luggage which he then would occasionally place in the corridor in front of his hotel room \u2013 especially when he was travelling alone. Among the best known actors Antel had worked with from the 1940s to the 1970s were Hans Moser, Paul H\u00f6rbiger, Oskar Werner, Curd J\u00fcrgens, Tony Curtis, Herbert Fux, Heinrich Schweiger, Arthur Kennedy, Carroll Baker, Edwige Fenech, George Hilton, Marisa Berenson, Britt Ekland, Andr\u00e9a Ferr\u00e9ol. 1981 was a turning point in Antel's career when he adapted for the big screen a stage play by Ulrich Becher and Peter Preses. Set from the days of the Anschluss of 1938 until after the end of the war,\" Der Bockerer\" is about a Viennese butcher named Karl Bockerer( Karl Merkatz) whose common sense rather than intellect tells him to oppose the Nazis and who dares to show resistance just because he is never fully aware of the possible fateful consequences of his actions. While Bockerer and his wife survive the war unscathed, their son joins the SA but, after some internal intrigue, is sent to the front and killed. The film was entered into the 12th Moscow International Film Festival. The film's strong anti-fascist message, the moving dialogue, and performances by the\" cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me\" of Austrian actors and actresses( Ida Krottendorf, Alfred B\u00f6hm, Heinz Marecek, Hans Holt, Dolores Schmidinger and many more) made\" Der Bockerer\" an unusually successful film and gave new impetus to Antel's career. He made three sequels, which follow the lives of the Bockerers well into the 1960s, each depicting a crucial historical event in Austria or one of its neighbouring countries: Ben Palmer is a British film and television director who is known for being the director of\" Bo' Selecta\" and\" The Inbetweeners\". Road to Perdition is a 2002 American crime film directed by Sam Mendes. The screenplay was adapted by David Self from the graphic novel of the same name written by Max Allan Collins and illustrated by Richard Piers Rayner. The film stars Tom Hanks, Paul Newman, Jude Law, and Daniel Craig. The plot takes place in 1931, during the Great Depression, following a mob enforcer and his son as they seek vengeance against a mobster who murdered the rest of their family. Filming took place in the Chicago area. Mendes, having recently finished 1999's acclaimed\" American Beauty\", pursued a story that had minimal dialogue and conveyed emotion in the imagery. Cinematographer Conrad L. Hall took advantage of the environment to create symbolism for the film, for which he won several awards, including a posthumous Academy Award for Best Cinematography. The film explores several themes, including the consequence of violence and father- son relationships. The film was released on July 12, 2002, and eventually grossed over$ 180 million worldwide. The cinematography, setting, and the lead performances by Hanks and Newman were well received by critics. It was released on home media on February 25, 2003.

I Want Your Love is the title of both a 2010 short film and a 2012 feature- length film. Both films were directed and written by Travis Mathews. The drama films both revolve around the friends and ex-lovers of Jesse Metzger, a gay man in his mid-thirties who is forced to move back to his hometown from San Francisco due to financial reasons. The actors' own names, along with much of their real- life stories, were used for their characters in both films, which features graphic sexual scenes. The production of both films was aided by the gay pornographic studio NakedSword. This led to the full- length film being refused exemption from classification, which would have allowed it to screen at the Melbourne Queer Film Festival, a decision to which actor James Franco( who invited Mathews to collaborate on Franco's film\" Interior. Leather Bar.\") reacted negatively. Matt Corboy( born June 4, 1973) is an American actor.
