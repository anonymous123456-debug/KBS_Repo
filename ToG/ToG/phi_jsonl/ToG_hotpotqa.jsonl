It usually refers to migrations after Christopher Columbus' voyage to the Americas in 1492. For earlier American migration, see the article on: Models of migration to the New World. The 1492 light sighting was a sighting of unknown light during the first voyage of Christopher Columbus on October 11, 1492, by some crew members of \"Santa Maria\", \"Pinta\" and possibly \"Ni\u00f1a\" shortly before the landing on Guanahani. The light was reported in Columbus' journal, Ferdinand Columbus' \"Vita del Ammiraglio\" (\"The Life of the Admiral\"), the proceedings of the \"Pleitos colombinos\" (the long lawsuit involving the heirs of Columbus) and some other sources. Columbus Day is a national holiday in many countries in the Americas and elsewhere which officially celebrates the anniversary of Christopher Columbus's arrival in the Americas on October 12, 1492. The landing is celebrated as \"\"Columbus Day\"\" in the United States, as \"\"D\u00eda de la Raza\"\" (\"Day of the Race\") in many countries in Latin America, as \"\"D\u00eda de la Hispanidad\"\" and \"\"Fiesta Nacional\"\" in Spain, where it is also the religious festivity of \"la Virgen del Pilar\", as \"D\u00eda de las Am\u00e9ricas\" (Day of the Americas) in Belize and Uruguay, as \"D\u00eda del Respeto a la Diversidad Cultural\" (Day of Respect for Cultural Diversity) in Argentina, and as \"Giornata Nazionale di Cristoforo Colombo\" or \"Festa Nazionale di Cristoforo Colombo\" in Italy and in the Little Italys around the world. These holidays have been celebrated unofficially since the late 18th century and officially in various countries since the early 20th century. The Columbus Monument (Catalan: \"Monument a Colom\" , ] ; Spanish: \"Monumento a Col\u00f3n \"or\" Mirador de Col\u00f3n\" ) is a 60 m tall monument to Christopher Columbus at the lower end of La Rambla, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. It was constructed for the Exposici\u00f3n Universal de Barcelona (1888) in honor of Columbus' first voyage to the Americas. The monument serves as a reminder that Christopher Columbus reported to Queen Isabella I and King Ferdinand V in Barcelona after his first trip to the new continent. Women have made significant contributions to Latin music, a genre which predates Italian explorer Christopher Columbus' arrival in Latin America in 1492 and the Spanish colonization of the Americas. The earliest musicians were Native Americans, hundreds of ethnic groups across the continent, whose lyrics \"reflect conflict, beauty, pain, and loss that mark all human experience.\" Indigenous communities reserved music for women, who were given equal opportunities with men to teach, perform, sing, and dance. Ethnomusicologists have measured ceramic, animal-bone, and cane flutes from the Inca Empire which indicate a preference for women with a high vocal range. Women had equal social status, were trained, and received the same opportunities in music as men in indigenous communities until the arrival of Columbus in the late 15th century. European settlers brought patriarchal, machismo ideologies to the continent, replacing the idea of equality between men and women. They equated native music with \"savagery\" and European music with \"civilization\". Female musicians tended to be darker-skinned as a result of the slave trade (which increased the population of African slaves), and contemporary society denigrated music as a profession. Latin music became Africanized, with syncopated rhythms and call-and-response; European settlement introduced harmony and the Spanish d\u00e9cima song form. In 1492, a Spanish-based transatlantic maritime expedition led by Christopher Columbus encountered the Americas, a continent which was previously unknown in Europe, leading to the colonization of the Americas. Columbus Breaking the Egg is a 1752 engraving by English artist William Hogarth. Issued as the subscription ticket for his treatise on art, \"The Analysis of Beauty\", it depicts an apocryphal tale (the \"Egg of Columbus\") concerning Christopher Columbus's response to detractors of his discovery of the New World. Hogarth uses the story as a parallel to what he considered his own discoveries in art. An egg of Columbus or Columbus' egg (Italian: \"uovo di Colombo\" ] ) refers to a brilliant idea or discovery that seems simple or easy after the fact. The expression refers to an apocryphal story in which Christopher Columbus, having been told that discovering the Americas was inevitable and no great accomplishment, challenges his critics to make an egg stand on its tip. After his challengers give up, Columbus does it himself by tapping the egg on the table to flatten its tip. Christopher Columbus's journal is a diary and logbook written by Christopher Columbus about his first voyage. The journal covers events from 3 August 1492, when Columbus departed from Palos de la Frontera, to 6 November of the same year. Columbus is known by several contemporary references to have kept a journal of the voyage as a daily record of events and as an evidence for the Catholic Monarchs. Upon his return to Spain in the spring of 1493 Columbus presented the journal to Isabella I of Castile. She had it copied, retained the original, and gave the copy to Columbus before his second voyage. The whereabouts of the original Spanish text has not been known since 1504. Copies based on an abstract from the journal have been made, most notably by Bartolom\u00e9 de las Casas. \"Prayer of Columbus\" is a poem written by American poet Walt Whitman. The poem evokes the enterprising spirit of the Christopher Columbus in a God-fearing light, who rediscovered the North American continent in 1492, leading to the colonization of the Americas by the emerging European powers. Although the Viking Leif Ericson has generally been credited as having discovered the North American continent roughly 500 years earlier, Columbus' rediscovery has had a more lasting impact on the colonization trends that continued until around the onset of World War I. Thus, Whitman's poem serves as a fitting tribute to the proper explorer.\n\nQuestion:\nAn egg of Columbus or Columbus' egg, refers to a brilliant idea or discovery that seems simple or easy after the fact, the expression refers to an apocryphal story in which 1492, a Spanish-based transatlantic maritime expedition led by Christopher Columbus encountered the Americas, a continent which was previously unknown in Europe, leading to the colonization of the Americas?\n\nPlease give the answer directly without any explanation.", "results": "Yes", "reasoning_chains": []}

DUATS, or Direct User Access Terminal Service is a weather information and flight plan processing service contracted by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for use by United States civil pilots and other authorized users. The DUAT Service is a telephone- and Internet-based system which allows the pilot to use a personal computer for access to a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) database to obtain weather and aeronautical information and to file, amend, and cancel domestic IFR and VFR flight plans. The DUAT Service provides direct access to weather information via a National Airspace System (NAS) Data Interchange Network II (NADIN-II) interface to the Weather Message Switching Center Replacement (WMSCR) System and the Air traffic control (ATC) Facilities for filing flight plans. The pilot users can interface the DUAT Services via the FTS-2001 toll free telephone numbers or via an Internet Interface into the Contractor's Facility. Richard H.

Certain DPEs also have authority to issue Flight Instructor Certificates and associated additional ratings. At the completion of the testing procedures, DPEs issue a \"Temporary Airman Certificate\" (pilot certificate) with the new qualifications or ratings, to be followed by a regular, credit-card-like certificate from FAA Airman Records following review of the certification file.

A practical test, more commonly known as a checkride, is the Federal Aviation Administration examination which one must undergo in the United States to receive an aircraft pilot's certification, or an endorsement for additional flight privileges. The name refers to the portion of the examination in which the candidate being examined flies in an aircraft with the Designated Pilot Examiner or other authorized examiner to demonstrate competency in the skills that are required for the certification. Although \"checkride\" is the most commonly used term, it is considered informal and is technically known as a Practical Test by the FAA and in all its literature, and the specific objectives which the candidate must meet are called the Practical Test Standards, or PTS.

It was released by Warner Bros. Records on March 26, 2012, to coincide with the release of her twelfth studio album, \"MDNA\". The eleven-disc box set was released in Europe and Japan, and included all of Madonna's studio albums from the years 1983 to 2008. The album artwork consisted of a collage of the album covers, housed in a gold box, it also included a Parental Advisory sticker due to the original version of the albums \"Erotica\" (1992) and \"American Life\" (2003). On the same date, Warner Bros. released and reprinted another box set titled \"Madonna: Original Album Series\" which included five discs. Chrome, Smoke & BBQ is a box set by American blues-rock band ZZ Top, released in 2003. At the time of release, this box set was notable for using the original mixes for all of the tracks from the band's first five albums for the first time on the CD format. This box set, and the companion release \"Rancho Texicano\", were the only two CD releases which featured original mixes from \"ZZ Top's First Album\", \"Rio Grande Mud\", and \"Tejas\", aside from 1977's \"The Best of ZZ Top\" which features two tracks from \"Rio Grande Mud\" and one track from \"First Album\". \"Tres Hombres\" and \"Fandango!\" were reissued in their original mixes in 2006, and in 2013, Warner Brothers released the CD box set 'The Complete Studio Albums 1970-1990' which includes the first ten ZZ Top studio albums, all with the original mixes. The Studio Albums 1992\u20132011 is an eleven compact disc box set by American progressive metal/rock band Dream Theater, released by Roadrunner on July 8, 2014. It contains ten of the original thirteen Dream Theater studio albums; as the title indicates, the box set spans the years from 1992 to 2011, and does not include the band's 1989 debut album \"When Dream and Day Unite\" or their self-titled twelfth studio album, which was released ten months before the box set. The albums are placed in chronological order. Brian Patrick Carroll (born May 13, 1969), known professionally as Buckethead, is an American musician who has worked within many genres of music. He has released 300 studio albums, four special releases, and one EP. He has also performed on more than 50 other albums by other artists. His music spans many diverse areas such as progressive metal, funk, blues, bluegrass, ambient, and avant-garde music. Radiohead Box Set is a box set of the first six studio albums and one live album by the English rock band Radiohead, released on 10 December 2007. The box set is available as a seven CD box set, a digital download and a 4GB USB Stick. The box set peaked at #95 in Canada's album charts. Buckethead is an American musician, predominantly a guitarist. The following is a discography of works by Buckethead, which currently consists of 302 studio albums (including 272 Pikes), 1 live album, 4 special releases, 1 extended play, 5 demo tapes, 3 solo DVD video releases, 2 DVD video releases with Cornbugs, 3 music videos, 3 unreleased albums, 3 solo videography releases, and 16 videography releases with other artists. Since 1994, Buckethead has released 6 studio efforts under the anagram of Death Cube K. He has released 74 works with other bands and artists (including his work as Death Cube K).

In total, Buckethead has been involved with 475 different album projects (as solo or with other bands). As of his 300th solo studio album, A3, his total solo studio album running time is approximately 159.02 hours. Led Zeppelin Boxed Set 2 is a double album released by Atlantic Records on 21 September 1993. This box set features the rest of the English rock band Led Zeppelin's catalogue not included in the 1990 4-CD box set \"Led Zeppelin\", all digitally remastered, including the previously unreleased studio track \"Baby Come On Home\". A 54-page booklet was also included with the release. Between this box set and the 4-CD box set every track from the band's nine studio albums are featured along with two BBC live recordings; the band's only non-LP b-side; and one studio outtake. Monolith is a box set made by avant-garde music composer Buckethead under the name of Death Cube K (an anagram of Buckethead), released in December 2007 through TDRS Music. Trash Box is a 5-CD box set of mid-1960s garage rock and psychedelic rock recordings, primarily by American bands. This box set is similar to the earlier \"Pebbles Box\" (a 5-LP box set) and includes almost all of the same recordings in that box set (and in the same order), along with numerous bonus tracks at the end of each disc. Supposedly, \"the Trash Box\" collects the first five volumes of the CDs in the Pebbles series (i.e., those released by AIP Records, not to be confused with the 4 earlier CDs that were issued by ESD Records). However, as is generally true of the CD reissues of these five volumes (though not nearly to the same extent), the tracks differ significantly on all five discs as compared to both the original Pebbles LPs and the later Pebbles CDs in the corresponding volumes; and the surf rock rarities on \"Pebbles, Volume 4\" have been eschewed entirely. Overall, there are 109 tracks in the box set (excluding the introduction and ending cuts) as compared to 101 songs on the individual CDs and 72 tracks in the \"Pebbles Box\". Although most of the recordings on \"the Trash Box\" were released at some point on one of the individual Pebbles albums, several of the songs have not appeared elsewhere in the Pebbles series. Inexplicably, one of these songs is the well-known hit \"I Fought the Law (but the Law Won)\" by the Bobby Fuller Four (on Disc Four) \u2013 which is also included in the \"Pebbles Box\" \u2013 in place of the much rarer \"Wine Wine Wine\" by Bobby Fuller that appears on \"Pebbles, Volume 2\". Four Light Years is a box set of three studio albums by Electric Light Orchestra (ELO). It was released in 1980 by Jet Records.vThe box contained three albums: \"A New World Record\" (1976), the double album \"Out of the Blue\" (1977), and \"Discovery\" (1979). Each album was a large commercial success in its own right, but unlike \"Three Light Years\" it did not chart as a combined collection on the UK Albums Chart. The set was so-titled because it covered four years, contained four vinyl records, and was a sequel to \"Three Light Years\" (1978). A proposed \"Across the Border\" EP was meant to promote the box set but was withdrawn. The EP version of the song would later turn up on the 1997 singles compilation \"Light Years\".\n\nQuestion:\nMonolith is a box set by what composer who has released 300 studio albums, four special releases, and one EP?\n\nPlease give the answer directly without any explanation.", "results": "Buckethead", "reasoning_chains": []}

The soundtrack to the film Deep Red was mainly composed and performed by the Italian progressive rock band Goblin. Director Dario Argento had originally contacted jazz pianist and composer Giorgio Gaslini to score the film, but he was unhappy with his output, deeming it \"awful\". After failing to get Pink Floyd to write music for the film, Argento turned back to Italy and found Goblin. In the final score, only three of Gaslini's original themes were retained; however, in the film's original theatrical release, Gaslini was given full composer credit for the entire score, while Goblin were wrongly credited only as performers [i.e. \"Music by Giorgio Gaslini, performed by Goblin\"]. This was corrected in subsequent home video releases. The 2015 IIHF World Championship Final was played at the O2 Arena in Prague, Czech Republic, on 17 May 2015 between Canada and Russia. The game started at 20:45 local time (). It was the third time since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 that Russia and Canada met in the IIHF World Championship Final.

Operation Entebbe was a successful counter-terrorist hostage-rescue mission carried out by commandos of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) at Entebbe Airport in Uganda on 4 July 1976. A week earlier, on 27 June, an Air France plane with 248 passengers had been hijacked by two members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine \u2013 External Operations (PFLP-EO) under orders of Wadie Haddad (who had earlier broken away from the PFLP of George Habash), and two members of the German Revolutionary Cells. The hijackers had the stated objective to free 40 Palestinian and affiliated militants imprisoned in Israel and 13 prisoners in four other countries in exchange for the hostages. The flight, which had originated in Tel Aviv with the destination of Paris, was diverted after a stopover in Athens via Benghazi to Entebbe, the main airport of Uganda. The Ugandan government supported the hijackers, and dictator Idi Amin personally welcomed them. After moving all hostages from the aircraft to a disused airport building, the hijackers separated all Israelis and several non-Israeli Jews from the larger group and forced them into a separate room. Over the following two days, 148 non-Israeli hostages were released and flown out to Paris. Ninety-four, mainly Israeli, passengers along with the 12-member Air France crew, remained as hostages and were threatened with death.

The Army's primary responsibility has been the fighting of land battles and military occupation. The Corps of Engineers has a major role in controlling rivers inside the United States. The Continental Army was founded in response to a need for professional soldiery in the American Revolutionary War in order to fight the invading British Army. Until the 1940s, the Army was relatively small in peacetime. In 1947, the Air Force became completely independent from the Army Air Forces. The Army was under the control of the War Department until 1947, and the Defense Department since then. The U.S. Army fought the War of 1812 (1812\u201315), American Civil War (1861\u201365), Spanish\u2013American War (1898), World War I (1917\u201318), World War II (1941\u201345), Korean War (1950\u201353) and Vietnam War (1965\u201371).

She is mostly known for adapting dramatic versions of Edward Bulwer-Lytton's\"Last Days of Pompeii\" (1835) and \"Ernest Maltravers\" (1838), and Robert Montgomery Bird's\"Nick of the Woods\" (1838), among others. In an era when successful plays typically ran 3-4 nights, \"Last Days of Pompeii\" set a record by running for twenty-nine days. This was the earliest known example of a \"long run\" for a play, a technique which became regularly used by Thomas Hamblin. Medina is also accredited as the first women in American Theatre to earn her living exclusively as a dramatist.

Due to their decision to continue \"The X-Files\" television series and try to appeal to a new generation of viewers, the production personnel knew from the beginning of season 8 that they were going to introduce another female character who would be a believer, as departing character Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) had been a believer. However, the writers wanted a different kind of believer character to contrast with the sceptical nature of John Doggett, who had already been established. The writers were required to create a character who was unlike any of the preconceived main characters that were a part of the series. This female character was initially named Karen Miller and then Jane Jones before the name \"Monica Reyes\" was decided upon, named after a friend of series creator Chris Carter's acquaintance who had an art gallery in Vancouver. The House of Mirth (1905), a novel by Edith Wharton (1862\u20131937), tells the story of Lily Bart, a well-born but impoverished woman belonging to New York City\u2019s high society around the turn of the last century. Wharton creates a portrait of a stunning beauty who, though raised and educated to marry well both socially and economically, is reaching her 29th year, an age when her youthful blush is drawing to a close and her marital prospects are becoming ever more limited. \"The House of Mirth\" traces Lily\u2019s slow two-year social descent from privilege to a tragically lonely existence on the margins of society. In the words of one scholar, Wharton uses Lily as an attack on \"an irresponsible, grasping and morally corrupt upper class.\"\n\nQuestion:\nWhich Actress played  both the main female character in the X-files as well as Lily Bart in The House of Mirth?\n\nPlease give the answer directly without any explanation.", "results": "Gillian Anderson", "reasoning_chains": []}

Sam Abell (born 1945 in Sylvania, Ohio) is an American photographer known for his frequent publication of photographs in \"National Geographic\". He first worked for \"National Geographic\" in 1967, and is one of the more overtly artistic photographers among his magazine peers. Sam Abell's style of photography is documentary in the sense that his major avenue, the \"National Geographic\" magazine, is a publication of record. However, his best work is known for its transcendent qualities, starting at the documentary level yet open to interpretation on an aesthetic level. One of his favorite photographs (based on how often he mentions it when asked about his work) is of the tree viewed through a Japanese window, which graces the cover of his book \"Seeing Gardens\". It's a documentary photograph of a tree, but due to a combination of light and Abell's inclusion in his composition of roof tiles in the background, the photograph takes on the transcendent, illusory quality of a stained glass window. Abell rarely uses flash, preferring a pure relationship with light. He has said that he could be perfectly happy with his photography even if his only subject was light itself. Clifford Joseph Harris Jr. (born September 25, 1980), known professionally as T.I. and Tip (often stylized as TIP or T.I.P.), is an American rapper and actor from Atlanta, Georgia.

The SAM, surveillance and monitoring, is able to capture even transient phenomenon such as in portal situations because it captures spectra in short time segments and produces a response from spectra with each time segment. Conversely, if the SAM is in a moving vehicle, it can quickly scan an area as the vehicle moves. The first line responder can email the SAM 935 data report for further analysis. \"For Your Country and My Country\" is a World War I era song released in 1917.

At Wabash College, Rogge taught in the summer Institute for Professional Development, in addition to his usual teaching in economics. Rogge co-authored an economics principles textbook with John Van Sickle. One strength of the text is the account that it gives of Joseph Schumpeter's process of creative destruction. Rogge helped organize a series of lectures by Milton Friedman at Wabash that were eventually developed into Friedman's \"Capitalism and Freedom\" book. Much later, Rogge participated in a brainstorming session for Friedman's Free to Choose television series. Liberty Fund was founded with money from Pierre Goodrich, who sought advice from Rogge during the Fund's early years. Rogge served for many years as a Liberty Fund trustee. Thomas Sowell gives Rogge credit for encouraging him to write a book on economics and race. Rogge also was a frequent presenter at the seminars of the Foundation for Economic Education (FEE). FEE's founder, Leonard Read, thought of Rogge as Read's eventual successor, an outcome prevented by Read outliving Rogge. An extended (but somewhat grainy) video clip of a Rogge FEE lecture on \"Competition and Monopoly\" on YouTube illustrates the dry wit that made him a popular speaker. Rogge attended 13 meetings of the influential international Mont Pelerin Society. Rogge helped produce, and narrated, a documentary on Adam Smith that was funded by Liberty Fund.

It is based on Python and wxWidgets, making it platform-independent in principle. It functions on all 32-bit versions of Microsoft Windows (95/98/NT/2000/XP), POSIX (Linux/BSD/UNIX-like OSes) and, to a limited extent, Mac OS X. Bibus is free software released under the GNU GPL v2+. HomeBank is a personal accounting software package that runs on OpenBSD, Linux, FreeBSD, Microsoft Windows, Mac OS (via macports or homebrew) and AmigaOS. Homebrew is a free and open-source software package management system that simplifies the installation of software on Apple's macOS operating system. Originally written by Max Howell, the package manager has gained popularity in the Ruby on Rails community and earned praise for its extensibility. Homebrew has been recommended for its ease of use as well as its integration into the command line. MacPorts, formerly called DarwinPorts, is a package management system that simplifies the installation of software on the macOS and Darwin operating systems. It is an open-source software project to simplify installation of other open source software. Similar in aim and function to Fink and the BSDs' ports collections, DarwinPorts was started in 2002 as part of the OpenDarwin project, with the involvement of a number of Apple Inc. employees including Landon Fuller, Kevin Van Vechten, and Jordan Hubbard. Ports collections (or \"ports trees\", or just \"ports\") are the sets of makefiles and patches provided by the BSD-based operating systems, FreeBSD, NetBSD, and OpenBSD, as a simple method of installing software or creating binary packages. They are usually the base of a package management system, with ports handling package creation and additional tools managing package removal, upgrade, and other tasks. In addition to the BSDs, a few Linux distributions have implemented similar infrastructure, including Gentoo's Portage, Arch's Arch Build System (ABS), CRUX's Ports and Void Linux's Templates. Microsoft Small Business Financials (formerly Microsoft Small Business Manager) is a business accounting software package. The software is targeting growing small businesses that require more than basic accounting software: with fewer than 25 employees and less than $10 million of revenue. It is part of Microsoft Dynamics (formerly Microsoft Business Solutions) family. It is based on Microsoft Dynamics GP and runs on top of free Microsoft MSDE or SQL Server Express database. Microsoft Small Business Financials and Microsoft Dynamics GP are built on the same platform, so migration to Microsoft Dynamics GP is very simple and straightforward. Open Systems Accounting Software (OSAS) is a business accounting software package for small- to medium-sized businesses using the Microsoft Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X operating systems. It has been developed and sold since 1976 by Open Systems, Inc. of Shakopee, MN. Pristine Sources is a software management concept coined by the developers of the short-lived Bogus Linux distribution and popularized by Marc Ewing, co-founder of Red Hat Inc, after he adopted it and RPM Package Manager as a development philosophy for Red Hat Linux. It was the concept that enabled Red Hat to build Linux distributions faster and more reliably than had been possible previously. Briefly, the problem with building an operating systems out of the myriad pieces of open source (or free software) components available from teams across the Internet was that there were many of these components and they all upgraded on different schedules at different times. Ewing's insight was to recognize that he could not take responsibility for these components. He and Erik Troan, wanted to build a software package management system, RPM, that allowed the team at Red Hat to avoid changing any of the source code of the software components they needed to use to build their Red Hat Linux operating system. The OpenBSD Cryptographic Framework (OCF) is a service virtualization layer for the uniform management of cryptographic hardware by an operating system. It is part of the OpenBSD Project, having been included in the operating system since OpenBSD 2.8 (December, 2000). Like other OpenBSD projects such as OpenSSH, it has been ported to other systems based on Berkeley Unix such as FreeBSD and NetBSD, and to Solaris and Linux. One of the Linux ports is supported by Intel for use with its proprietary cryptographic software and hardware to provide hardware-accelerated SSL encryption for the open source Apache HTTP Server.

The 350Z entered production in late 2002 and was sold and marketed as a 2003 model. The first year there was only a coupe, as the roadster did not debut until the following year. Initially, the coupe came in base, Enthusiast, Performance, Touring and Track versions, while the roadster was limited to Enthusiast and Touring trim levels. The Track trim came with lightweight wheels and Brembo brakes, but its suspension tuning was the same as all other coupes. The Nissan 350Z has been succeeded by the 370Z since the 2009 model year. The Nissan NX is a front wheel drive 2-door sports car produced by Nissan Motors. The NX was, loosely, an evolution of the Nissan Pulsar NX/Nissan EXA sold from 1987\u20131990 and the Nissan Sunny Coupe lines of the 1970s and 1980s, merging the Nissan B13 and N14 lineages. The NX was released in Japan in 1990. The 2009 Formula D season (officially titled Formula Drift Professional Championship) was the sixth season for the Formula D series. The series began April 11 and concluded on October 11. Chris Forsberg took his first series title in a Nissan 350Z; the third season in succession in which a Nissan car had won the championship.

Nicholas Jacobus Roosevelt or Nicholas James Roosevelt (December 27, 1767, New York City \u2013 July 30, 1854, Skaneateles, New York) was an American inventor, a major investor in Upstate New York land, and a member of the Roosevelt family. His primary invention was to introduce vertical paddle wheels for steamboats. Jacobus Roosevelt III, known as James Roosevelt, (January 10, 1760 \u2013 February 6, 1847) was an American businessman and politician from New York City and a member of the Roosevelt family. The Roosevelt family is an American business and political family from New York whose members have included two United States Presidents, a First Lady, and various merchants, politicians, inventors, clergymen, artists, and socialites. Descendants of a mid-17th century Dutch immigrant to New Amsterdam, many members of the family became locally prominent in New York City business and politics and intermarried with prominent colonial families. Two distantly related branches of the family from Oyster Bay on Long Island and Hyde Park in Dutchess County, Upstate New York, achieved national political prominence with the elections of Presidents Theodore Roosevelt (1901\u20131909) and his fifth cousin Franklin D. Roosevelt (1933\u20131945), whose wife, First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, was Theodore's niece. Hyde House is a historic house at 144 W. Park Street in Lee, Massachusetts. The house was built in 1792 as the home of Lee's first minister, Alvan Hyde. The three story colonial house features six working original fireplaces and original wide pine flooring. Rev. Hyde served as minister to Lee's First Congregational Church for 41 years; the house eventually passed to his son, Alexander, who opened a school at the residence. The \"Hyde House Boarding School for Boys\" drew students from as far off as Boston, New York City, and Chicago; among its notable students was James Roosevelt, father of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. At this time an academic wing was added to the back of the house, with a schoolroom on the lower floor and student bedrooms above. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. James Roosevelt I (July 16, 1828 \u2013 December 8, 1900), known as \"Squire James\", was an American businessman and horse breeder, and the father of American President Franklin Delano Roosevelt.

His mother was the immortal nereid Thetis, and his father, the mortal Peleus, was the king of the Myrmidons. Pkharmat (Chechen: \u041f\u0445\u044c\u0430\u0440\u043c\u0430\u0442, P\u1e8barmat , Creator of the nation, language or land) is a legendary hero of the Vainakh people who brought fire to mankind and was chained to the Mount Kazbek. This allowed them to forge metal, cook and illuminate their houses. As a result of this, the people united and became a nation. Pkharmat is the Vainakh equivalent of the Greek hero Prometheus and the Georgian mythology hero Amirani, among others. In Greek mythology, Lyrnessus was a town or city in Dardania (Asia minor), inhabited by Cilicians. It was closely associated with the nearby Cilician Thebe. At the time of the Trojan War, it was said to have been ruled by a king named Mynes. His widowed wife is Briseis, who later became a prize of Achilles. Ithaka is a 1996 play by the German writer Botho Strau\u00df. It has the subtitle \"Schauspiel nach den Heimkehr-Ges\u00e4ngen der Odyssee\", meaning \"play after the homecoming songs from the \"Odyssey\"\". It tells the story of how Odysseus, the Greek hero from the Trojan War, returns after 20 years to his court in Ithaca, where he massacres the suitors of his wife Penelope to recreate order. Heraclea Lyncestis also spelled Herakleia Lynkestis (Greek: \u1f29\u03c1\u03ac\u03ba\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 \u039b\u03c5\u03b3\u03ba\u03b7\u03c3\u03c4\u03af\u03c2 ; Latin: \"Heraclea Lyncestis\" ; Macedonian: \u0425\u0435\u0440\u0430\u043a\u043b\u0435\u0430 \u041b\u0438\u043d\u043a\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0441 , was an ancient Greek city in Macedon, ruled later by the Romans. Its ruins are situated 2\u00a0km south of the present-day town of Bitola, Macedonia. It was founded by Philip II of Macedon in the middle of the 4th century BC. The city was named in honor of the mythological Greek hero Heracles. The name \"Lynkestis\" originates from the name of the ancient kingdom, conquered by Philip, where the city was built. Operas based on the Orphean myths, and especially the story of Orpheus' journey to the underworld to rescue his wife, Eurydice, were amongst the earliest examples of the art form and continue to be written into the 21st century. Orpheus, the Greek hero whose songs could charm both gods and wild beasts and coax the trees and rocks into dance, has achieved an emblematic status as a metaphor for the power of music. The following is an annotated list of operas (and works in related genres) based on his myth. The works are listed with their composers and arranged by date of first performance. In cases where the opera was never performed, the approximate date of composition is given. Chaon (Greek: \u03a7\u03ac\u03c9\u03bd , gen.: \u03a7\u03ac\u03bf\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2) was a Greek hero and the eponymous ancestor of the Chaonians who gave his name to Chaonia, a district in northwestern Epirus in Greece. The stories are unclear as to whether he was the friend or the brother of Helenus, but in either case, he accompanied him to the court of Neoptolemus. The stories concerning Chaon's death are as unclear as that of his relationship to Helenus. Chaon was either killed in a hunting accident or offered himself as a sacrifice to the gods during an epidemic, thus saving the lives of his countrymen. In either case, when Helenus became the ruler of the country, he named a part of the kingdom after Chaon. Achilles on Skyros is an episode in the myth of Achilles, a Greek hero of the Trojan War. Not existing in Homer's epic poem \"Iliad\", the episode is written down in detail in some later versions of the story, particularly the \"Achilleid\" by the Roman poet Statius. The story of how Achilles disguised himself as a girl at the court of the king of Skyros, fell in love with one of the princesses, and married her before leaving for Troy, became a popular topic in arts and literature from Classical times until the middle of the 20th century. The carnavalesque disguises and gender transpositions at the heart of the story were particularly popular in opera, with over 30 different operas on the theme between 1641 and 1857. Stepan Fyodorovich Shutov (Russian: \u0421\u0442\u0435\u043f\u0430\u043d \u0424\u0451\u0434\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0428\u0443\u0442\u043e\u0432; 30 January 1902 \u2013 17 April 1963) was a Red Army Colonel and double Hero of the Soviet Union. Shutov fought in the Russian Civil War and the Polish\u2013Soviet War. He was demobilized after recovering from Typhus in 1921 but was drafted into the Red Army again in 1924. He initially served in cavalry units and later became an officer in the tank troops. When Germany invaded the Soviet Union, Shutov was a tank battalion commander. He fought in the Battle of Moscow. In December 1941 he became deputy commander of a tank brigade and in August 1942 was given command of the 187th Tank Brigade of the 9th Tank Corps. Shutov was appointed commander of the 50th Separate Guards Tank Regiment in October. From May 1943 he took commanders courses at the Military Academy of the Mechanization and Motorization of the Red Army. After graduation Shutov became commander of the 20th Guards Tank Brigade in August 1943. For his leadership of the brigade in the Battle of Kiev (1943), he was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union. During the Jassy\u2013Kishinev Offensive the brigade captured Ploie\u0219ti. For his leadership Shutov was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union a second time. In September 1944 he became 9th Guards Mechanized Corps deputy commander but a few days later was seriously wounded, resulting in the amputation of his arm while in the hospital. He retired in September 1945 and later became deputy minister for social welfare of the Belorussian SSR. 1583 Antilochus ( ), provisional designation 1950 SA, is a dark and reddish Jupiter trojan from the Greek camp, approximately 105 kilometers in diameter.

You will be given several paragraphs as context.  \nPlease carefully read all the information and answer the question using reasoning across the paragraphs.  \nProvide the answer directly without adding any explanation.\n\nContext:\nAmica is an opera in two acts by Pietro Mascagni, originally composed to a libretto by Paul B\u00e9rel (the pseudonym of Paul de Choudens). The only opera by Mascagni with a French libretto, it was an immediate success with both the audience and the critics on its opening night at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Casino in Monte-Carlo on 16 March 1905. Mascagni himself conducted the performance. The opera had its Italian premiere (with an Italian libretto by Mascagni's close collaborator, Giovanni Targioni-Tozzetti) on 13 May 1905 at the Teatro Costanzi in Rome. This is a discography of Cavalleria rusticana, an opera by Pietro Mascagni. It premiered at the Teatro Costanzi in Rome on 17 May 17, 1890. There have been over 100 full-length recordings of \"Cavalleria rusticana\" published since it was first recorded in Germany in 1909. Mascagni himself has conducted the opera in two recordings, the best-known of which is the 1940 EMI recording made to mark the 50th anniversary of the opera's premiere. The performance by the La Scala orchestra and chorus with Lina Bruna Rasa as Santuzza and Beniamino Gigli as Turiddu also has a spoken introduction by Mascagni. Originally released as an LP, it is available on CD under several historical recording labels, including Naxos. Lina Bruna Rasa (24 September 1907 \u2013 October 1984) was an Italian operatic soprano. She was particularly noted for her performances in the verismo repertoire and was a favourite of Pietro Mascagni who considered her the ideal Santuzza. Bruna Rasa created the roles of Atte in Mascagni's \"Nerone\", Cecilia Sagredo in Franco Vittadini's \"La Sagredo\" and Saint Clare in 's 1926 oratorio, \"Trittico Francescano\". She also sang the role of Tsaritsa Militrisa in the Italian premiere of Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov's \"The Tale of Tsar Saltan\". Monsignor Lorenzo Perosi (21 December 1872 \u2013 12 October 1956) was an Italian composer of sacred music and the only member of the Giovane Scuola who did not write opera. In the late 1890s, while he was still only in his 20s, Perosi was an internationally celebrated composer of sacred music, especially large-scale oratorios. Nobel Prize winner Romain Rolland wrote, \"It's not easy to give you an exact idea of how popular Lorenzo Perosi is in his native country.\" Perosi's fame was not restricted to Europe. A 19 March 1899 \"New York Times\" article entitled \"The Genius of Don Perosi\" began, \"The great and ever-increasing success which has greeted the four new oratorios of Don Lorenzo Perosi has placed this young priest-composer on a pedestal of fame which can only be compared with that which has been accorded of late years to the idolized Pietro Mascagni by his fellow-countrymen.\" Gianandrea Gavazzeni made the same comparison: \"The sudden clamors of applause, at the end of the [19th] century, were just like those a decade earlier for Mascagni.\" Perosi worked for five Popes, including Pope St. Pius X who greatly fostered his rise. Mala Pasqua! (Bad Easter!) is an opera in three acts composed by Stanislao Gastaldon to a libretto by Giovanni Domenico Bartocci-Fontana. The libretto is based on Giovanni Verga's play, \"Cavalleria rusticana\" (\"Rustic Chivalry\") which Verga had adapted from his short story of the same name. \"Mala Pasqua!\" premiered on 9 April 1890 at the Teatro Costanzi in Rome, six weeks before Pietro Mascagni's opera \"Cavalleria rusticana\" which was also based on Verga's play. Bartocci-Fontana's libretto adds some elements that were not in Verga's original and expands on others. The name of the Santuzza character was also changed to Carmela, but the basic plot and setting remain the same. Its title refers to the curse which Carmela places on Turiddu, the lover who had spurned her: \"Mala Pasqua a te!\" (\"May you have an evil Easter!\"). Following its Rome premiere \"Mala Pasqua!\" had a few more performances in Perugia and Lisbon, but it was completely eclipsed by the phenomenal success of Mascagni's opera. After the 1891 Lisbon run it was not heard again until 2010 when it was given a semi-staged performance in Agrigento, Sicily. Richard Georg Strauss (11 June 1864 \u2013 8 September 1949) was a leading German composer of the late Romantic and early modern eras. He is known for his operas, which include \"Der Rosenkavalier\", \"Elektra\", \"Die Frau ohne Schatten\" and \"Salome\"; his Lieder, especially his \"Four Last Songs\"; his tone poems, including \"Don Juan\", \"Death and Transfiguration\", \"Till Eulenspiegel's Merry Pranks\", \"Also sprach Zarathustra\", \"Ein Heldenleben\", \"Symphonia Domestica\", and \"An Alpine Symphony\"; and other instrumental works such as \"Metamorphosen\" and his Oboe Concerto. Strauss was also a prominent conductor in Western Europe and the Americas, enjoying quasi-celebrity status as his compositions became standards of orchestral and operatic repertoire. Mark Delavan is an American operatic bass-baritone. He made his professional debut in 1986 at the San Francisco Opera in a small role in Giuseppe Verdi's \"Don Carlos\". He spent the next three years performing in numerous comprimario roles with the company. He has since returned to that opera house to sing Scarpia in Giacomo Puccini's \"Tosca\" (2004, with Carol Vaness in the title role) and Wotan in Richard Wagner's \"The Ring Cycle\" (2008, 2010, and 2011). In 2001 he made his debut at the Metropolitan Opera as Amonasro in Verdi's \"Aida\" with Deborah Voigt in the title role, Luciano Pavarotti as Radam\u00e8s, Olga Borodina as Amneris, and James Levine conducting. He has since been heard at the Met as Alfio in Pietro Mascagni's \"Cavalleria rusticana\", Carlo G\u00e9rard in \"Andrea Ch\u00e9nier\", Count Tomsky in \"The Queen of Spades\", Don Carlo in Verdi's \"La Forza del Destino\", the Messenger in Richard Strauss' \"Die Frau ohne Schatten\", Scarpia, and the title roles in Verdi's \"Nabucco\", Verdi's \"Rigoletto\", and Verdi's \"Simon Boccanegra\". Pietro Antonio Stefano Mascagni (] ; 7 December 1863 \u2013 2 August 1945) was an Italian composer most noted for his operas. His 1890 masterpiece \"Cavalleria Rusticana\" caused one of the greatest sensations in opera history and single-handedly ushered in the \"Verismo\" movement in Italian dramatic music. While it was often held that Mascagni, like Leoncavallo, was a \"one-opera man\" who could never repeat his first success, \"L'amico Fritz\" and \"Iris\" have remained in the repertoire in Europe (especially Italy) since their premieres. Mascagni said that at one point, \"Iris\" was performed in Italy more often than \"Cavalleria\" (cf. Stivender). Valery Kritskov is a Russian conductor who used to take conducting lessons at the Moscow Institute of Culture which were taught by Kirill Tikhonov. He graduated from there in 1988 and then worked in Moscow-based Helikon Opera till he got employed with Novaya Opera in 2002. While there, he conducted many operas including Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov's \"The Snow Maiden\" and \"The Tsar\u2019s Bride\" as well as Anton Rubinstein's \"The Demon\" and Tchaikovsky's \"The Maid of Orleans\". He also conducted works by the Italian composers such as Pietro Mascagni's \"Cavalleria rusticana\" and Ruggero Leoncavallo's \"Pagliacci\" and German such as Richard Wagner's \"Lohengrin\" and Strauss' \"Die Fledermaus\" as well as a concert dedicated to Vincenzo Bellini. Besides operas, he is also known for his conducting of the Russian ballet based on works by Tchaikovsky and Sergei Prokofiev as well as German and Austrian ballet composers such as Ludwig Minkus and Charles Gounod. Later on, he became a conductor of the Copp\u00e9lia ballet which was based by L\u00e9o Delibes work and was produced by Imperial Russian Ballet. Currently he has two CD recordings called \"Chorus of the Novaya Opera Theatre of Moscow\" and the \"Soloists of the Novaya Opera Theatre of Moscow\". Rapsodia Satanica was a 1915 silent film directed by Nino Oxilia featuring Lyda Borelli in a female version of Faust based on poems by Fausto Maria Martini. Pietro Mascagni wrote his only film music for the film and conducted the first performance in July 1917. Mascagni was keen to take commission for the film music due to the financial burden of supporting two sickening brothers. The French-German TV channel Arte restored the film in 2006 and Deutsche Staatsphilharmonie Rheinland-Pfalz, conducted by Frank Strobel recorded Mascagni's score.\n\nQuestion:\nWho died first Richard Strauss or Pietro Mascagni?\n\nPlease give the answer directly without any explanation.", "results": "Richard Strauss died in 1949, Pietro Mascagni died in 1945.

Burlingham allegedly received the nickname of \"Bungtown\" in the late 1800 when the local women became upset with their husbands for spending too much time at the local saloon and knocked all of the bungs out of the whiskey barrels. The escaping liquor was then used to burn down the saloon. Bourbon whiskey is a type of American whiskey, a barrel-aged distilled spirit made primarily from corn. The name is derived from the French Bourbon dynasty, although it is unclear precisely what inspired the whiskey's name (contenders include Bourbon County in Kentucky and Bourbon Street in New Orleans). Bourbon has been distilled since the 18th century. The use of the term \"bourbon\" for the whiskey has been traced to the 1820s, and the term began to be used consistently in Kentucky in the 1870s. While bourbon may be made anywhere in the United States, it is strongly associated with the American South, and with Kentucky in particular. As of 2014, the distillers' wholesale market revenue for bourbon sold within the U.S. is about $2.7 billion, and bourbon makes up about two-thirds of the $1.6 billion of U.S. exports of distilled spirits. In 1927, during the height of Prohibition, Midwest gangster Al Capone decided that so much liquor was flowing into the United States across the Canada\u2013US border through Detroit that he decide he wanted in on the action. After some negotiations, he formed a partnership with the Purple Gang of Detroit. They took Canadian Club Whiskey, labeled it \"Old Log Cabin\" Whiskey. One of the people that Capone sold Old Log Cabin to was fellow Chicago bootlegger, Bugs Moran. Bugs Moran decided that he wasn't making enough money off his liquor sales and decided to re-buy Old Log Cabin from hijackers at half the price. Moran's crew started hijacking the Purple Gang supply trucks heading into Detroit. In May 1792, American merchant sea captain Robert Gray sailed into the Columbia River, becoming the first recorded European to navigate into it. The voyage, conducted on the \"Columbia Rediviva\", a privately owned ship, was eventually used as a basis for the United States' claim on the Pacific Northwest, although its relevance to the claim was disputed by the British. As a result of the outcome the river was afterwards named after the ship. Gray spent nine days on the river trading fur pelts before sailing out of the river. \"Soldier's Joy\" is a fiddle tune, classified as a reel or country dance. It is popular in the American fiddle canon, in which it is touted as \"an American classic\" but traces its origin to Scottish fiddling traditions, and Irish fiddle traditions. It has been played in Scotland for over 200 years, and Robert Burns used it for the first song of his cantata 'The Jolly Beggars'. According to documentation at the United States Library of Congress, it is \"one of the oldest and most widely distributed tunes\" and is rated in the top ten most-played Old Time Fiddle tune. According to the Illinois Humanities Center, the tune dates as early as the 1760s. In spite of its upbeat tempo and catchy melody, the term \"soldier's joy\" has a much darker meaning than is portrayed by the tune. This term eventually came to refer to the combination of whiskey, beer, and morphine used by Civil War soldiers. Government procurement in the United States is the process by which the Federal Government of the United States acquires goods, services (notably construction), and interests in real property. In FY 2016 alone the US Federal Government spent $461B on contracts. Contracts for Government procurement usually involve appropriated funds spent on supplies, services, and interests in real property by and for the use of the Federal Government through purchase or lease, whether the supplies, services, or interests are already in existence or must be created, developed, demonstrated, and evaluated. \"See\" 48 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.101 (\"Acquisition\" defined, as to goods and services only). Federal Government contracting has the same legal elements as contracting between private parties: a lawful purpose, competent contracting parties, an offer, an acceptance that complies with the terms of the offer, mutuality of obligation, and consideration. However, Federal contracts are much more heavily regulated, subject to volumes of statutes dealing with Federal contracts and the Federal contracting process, mostly in Titles 10, 31, 40, and 41 of the United States Code. 1792 Whiskey is a Kentucky straight Bourbon whiskey produced by the Barton 1792 Distillery in Bardstown, Kentucky.

William Goodell (1792\u20131867) was an American missionary. He was born at Templeton, Mass., educated at Phillips Academy (Andover), Dartmouth College, and Andover Theological Seminary. He was accepted as a missionary by the American Board and at the close of 1822 sailed for Malta and thence the next year went to Beirut, where he aided in establishing the station which became the center of the Syrian mission. In 1828, on account of threatened war between England and Turkey, the missionaries removed to Malta, where Goodell labored in preparing and printing books for the mission; until, in 1831, the way having been opened by the destruction of the Turkish fleet at Navarino, he went to Constantinople, where he commenced the Armeno-Turkish mission. During his missionary life he and his devoted wife cheerfully endured many trials and perils and were compelled to move their residence 33 times in 29 years. One of his chief labors was the translation of the Bible into Armeno-Turkish (Turkish written in Armenian letters), in making and revising which he spent 20 years. In 1865, after 43 years of toil, he returned to the United States and died in Philadelphia at the residence of his son, Dr. William Goodell, on February 18, 1867. Consult his life by Prime (New York, 1876). The Militia Acts of 1792 were a pair of statutes enacted by the second United States Congress in 1792.

It was named after the nearby city of Ignalina. Due to the plant's similarities to the failed Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in both reactor design and lack of a robust containment building, Lithuania agreed to close the plant as part of its accession agreement to the European Union. Unit\u00a01 was closed in December 2004. The remaining Unit 2 which counted for 25% of Lithuania's electricity generating capacity and supplied about 70% of Lithuania's electrical demand, was closed on December 31, 2009.

It was designed by \u00c9mile Dewoitine and developed by the Instituto Aerot\u00e9cnico for manufacture by the company H. Goberna factories in C\u00f3rdoba Province as an initiative under President Juan Per\u00f3n's first five year plan. The Music Encoding Initiative (MEI) is an open-source effort to create a system for representation musical documents in a machine-readable structure. MEI closely mirrors work done by text scholars in the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) and while the two encoding initiatives are not formally related, they share many common characteristics and development practices. The term \"MEI\", like \"TEI\", describes the governing organization and the markup language. The MEI community solicits input and development directions from specialists in various music research communities, including technologists, librarians, historians, and theorists in a common effort to discuss and define best practices for representing a broad range of musical documents and structures. The results of these discussions are then formalized into the MEI schema, a core set of rules for recording physical and intellectual characteristics of music notation documents. This schema is expressed in an XML Schema Language, with RelaxNG being the preferred format. The MEI schema is developed using the One-Document-Does-it-all (ODD) format, a literate programming XML format developed by the Text Encoding Initiative.

Originally established in 1898 as the \"San Francisco Mountains National Forest Reserve\", the area was designated a U.S. National Forest in 1908 when the San Francisco Mountains National Forest Reserve was merged with lands from other surrounding forest reserves to create the Coconino National Forest. Today, the Coconino National Forest contains diverse landscapes, including deserts, ponderosa pine forests, flatlands, mesas, alpine tundra, and ancient volcanic peaks. The forest surrounds the towns of Sedona and Flagstaff and borders four other national forests; the Kaibab National Forest to the west and northwest, the Prescott National Forest to the southwest, the Tonto National Forest to the south, and the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest to the southeast. The forest contains all or parts of ten designated wilderness areas, including the Kachina Peaks Wilderness, which includes the summit of the San Francisco Peaks. The headquarters are in Flagstaff. There are local ranger district offices in Flagstaff, Happy Jack, and Sedona. The Pinal Mountains (Yavapai: Walkame) are a mountain range located in Gila County, Arizona. They have a maximum elevation of 7,848 ft at Pinal Peak and a prominence of over 4,000 ft . The closest city is the Globe, Arizona/Miami, Arizona area, which is just a few miles north of the mountain range. The mountains are located within the Tonto National Forest, and their recreational facilities are maintained by the USDA's United States Forest Service. The San Carlos Indian Reservation is very close to the mountain range, with its boundaries being just a few miles east/northeast of the range. The mountains are covered with Ponderosa Pine and white fir and experience cooler weather than the Globe/Miami area, so that they are a popular recreation area in the summer. The maintained facilities include a maintained dirt road that goes all the way to the summit of Pinal Peak, a campsite and recreational area, many hiking trails, as well as some radio towers near both Pinal and Signal peaks ( the two highest peaks of the range ). The mountain range covers an area of 45,760 acres. Wilson State Park is a public recreation area found on the south shore of 9000 acre Wilson Lake reservoir approximately 10 mi north of the city of Wilson in Russell County, Kansas, United States. Located at the reservoir's eastern end, the state park covers 945 acres divided into two areas by the reservoir's southeastern arm: the Hell Creek area on the west side and the Otoe area on the east side. The Hell Creek area hosts a marina. Both areas include hiking trails, swimming beaches, boat ramps, and camping facilities. The Wind River Range (or \"Winds\" for short), is a mountain range of the Rocky Mountains in western Wyoming in the United States. The range runs roughly NW-SE for approximately 100\u00a0miles (161\u00a0km). The Continental Divide follows the crest of the range and includes Gannett Peak, which at 13,804\u00a0feet (4,207\u00a0m), is the highest peak in Wyoming. There are more than 40 other named peaks in excess of 13,000\u00a0feet (3,962\u00a0m). With the exception of the Grand Teton in the Teton Range, the next 19 highest peaks in Wyoming after Gannett are also in the Winds. Two large National Forests including three wilderness areas encompass most of the mountain range. Shoshone National Forest is on the eastern side of the continental divide while Bridger-Teton National Forest is on the west. Both National Forests and the entire mountain range are an integral part of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. Portions of the range are also inside the Wind River Indian Reservation. The Elkhead Mountains are a mountain range in Colorado. The mountain range is considered to be low altitude within Colorado as the mountains are under 11000 ft . Located within Routt and Moffat counties, the mountain range is far from metropolitan areas and has few lakes and streams, so it attracts few visitors. The mountain range is a volcanic range and all of the peaks were formed by volcanic action. The mountain range extends approximately 16 mi east to west and 10 mi north to south, and its center is located at , approximately 20 mi northeast of Craig and north of Hayden, Colorado 13 mi south of the Wyoming border. Almost all of the peaks within the Elkhead Mountains are a part of Routt National Forest. Significant peaks are: Bears Ears, Sugar Loaf, Saddle Mountain, Black Mountain, Pilot Knob, and Meaden Peak. The Wilson Creek area is located in the Grandfather district of the Pisgah National Forest, in the northwestern section of Caldwell County, North Carolina. Wilson Creek itself is a water system that originates in Calloway Peak and stretches for 23 miles before dumping into John's River. It was added to the Wild and Scenic River System on August 18, 2000. There are several designations in Wilson creek area which include: Wild - 4.6 miles; Scenic - 2.9 miles; Recreational - 15.8 miles. The Palouse Forest Reserve and after March 4, 1907, the Palouse National Forest was established by Presidential Proclamation (34 U.S. Statutes at Large 3293) on March 2, 1907 and was one of President Theodore Roosevelt's Midnight forests, created before the federal law banning new forest reserves in six western states, including Idaho, became effective. The conventional wisdom has the name \u2018palouse\u2019 being derived from the French term for the large treeless plain region in eastern Washington stretching into Idaho: the Palouse, a word meaning grassy spot or place. However, Boone says that the name could originate from the name of a major village of Palouse Indians, Palus, located at the confluence of the Palouse and Snake Rivers. 'Palus' is the Sachapin Indian word for \u201csomething sticking down in the water,\u201d in this case the something was a large rock, thought to be a beaver\u2019s heart, and which had an important religious significance for the Palouse Indians. The Palouse National Forest had its administrative headquarters in the town of Wallace, Idaho for its 15-month existence and was administered by the U.S. Forest Service with 194404 acre . With the issuance of Executive Order 843 by President Roosevelt on June 26, 1908, with an effective date of July 1, 1908, the entire forest was absorbed by the Coeur d'Alene National Forest and the area ceased to be an independently administered national forest. The lands of the former Palouse National Forest were then administered as part of the Coeur d\u2019Alene National Forest for three years before being combined with other lands to establish the St. Joe National Forest on July 1, 1911. The area of the former Palouse National Forest formed the western portion of the St. Joe National Forest. Once transferred in 1911, the area of the Palouse National Forest became the Palouse Ranger District of the St. Joe National Forest and is still considered part of the St. Joe National Forest. However, it has been administered by the Clearwater National Forest since the 1973 administrative merger of the Kaniksu National Forest, Coeur d\u2019Alene, and St. Joe National Forests into the Idaho Panhandle National Forests. The Rock Creek Roadless Area (B032) is located northwest of Buffalo, Wyoming, in the Bighorn National Forest. It comprises roughly 34000 acre of forested timberlands, mountain parks, rugged canyons, and stunning rock formations. This area represents the entire spectrum of environments found in the Bighorn National Forest and encompasses prairie land to high alpine peaks. This roadless area is the source of the north, middle, and south forks of Rock Creek, Balm of Gilead Creek, Pheasant Creek, and Ditch Creek. The area is flanked on the eastern side by the Bud Love Big Game Winter Range and the HF Bar Ranch Historic District. On the southern side the roadless area is surrounded by the Paradise Guest Ranch. The roadless area is home to elk, moose, mountain lion, pine marten, blue grouse, ruffed grouse, and raptors. The Rock Creek area is the largest area of quality elk security habitat outside of the Cloud Peak Wilderness Area and would provide an important corridor from the high country to the Bud Love Habitat Management Unit. The Rock Creek roadless area is dominated by lodgepole pine, some ponderosa, and aspen stands with low-growing juniper in the undergrowth. The area has not been opened to roads due to the ruggedness of the landscape and the high costs of implementation. Pisgah National Forest is a National Forest in the Appalachian Mountains of western North Carolina. It is administered by the United States Forest Service, part of the United States Department of Agriculture. The Pisgah National Forest is completely contained within the state of North Carolina. The forest is managed together with the other three North Carolina National Forests (Croatan, Nantahala, and Uwharrie) from common headquarters in Asheville, North Carolina. There are local ranger district offices located in Pisgah Forest, Mars Hill, and Nebo. Cache National Forest is a 533,840-acre area of National Forest System land in Idaho and Utah which was established on July 1, 1908 by the U.S. Forest Service. The majority of its area is in Utah, and was initially created when the Bear River National Forest was disbanded. On July 1, 1915, all of Pocatello National Forest was added. In 1973 the Idaho portion was transferred to the administration of Caribou National Forest, while the Utah portion was combined administratively with Wasatch National Forest, creating the Wasatch-Cache National Forest. In descending order of forestland area, the Cache National Forest portion is located in Cache, Bear Lake, Franklin, Weber, Rich, Box Elder, Caribou, and Morgan counties. (Bear Lake, Franklin, and Caribou counties are in Idaho, and the rest in Utah.) The forest has a current area of 701453 acre , which comprises 43.56% of the combined Wasatch-Cache's total acreage. The forest is administered from Salt Lake City, Utah as part of the Wasatch-Cache National Forest, but there are local ranger district offices in Logan and Ogden. From circa 1911 until August 1923, the area was roamed by Old Ephraim.\n\nQuestion:\nThe national forest that includes the Wilson Creek area is located in what mountain range?\n\nPlease give the answer directly without any explanation.", "results": "Palouse Mountains", "reasoning_chains": []}

It is also an American brand of resonator guitar, currently owned by the Gibson Guitar Corporation. The Dobro was originally made by the Dopyera brothers when they formed the Dobro Manufacturing Company. Their design, with a single inverted resonator, was introduced in competition to the patented Tricone and biscuit designs produced by the National String Instrument Corporation. The Dobro name appeared on other instruments, notably electric lap steel guitars and solid body electric guitars and on other resonator instruments such as Safari resonator mandolins. The horse (\"Equus ferus caballus\") is one of two extant subspecies of \"Equus ferus\". It is an odd-toed ungulate mammal belonging to the taxonomic family Equidae. The horse has evolved over the past 45 to 55\u00a0million years from a small multi-toed creature, \"Eohippus\", into the large, single-toed animal of today. Humans began to domesticate horses around 4000 BC, and their domestication is believed to have been widespread by 3000 BC. Horses in the subspecies \"caballus\" are domesticated, although some domesticated populations live in the wild as feral horses. These feral populations are not true wild horses, as this term is used to describe horses that have never been domesticated, such as the endangered Przewalski's horse, a separate subspecies, and the only remaining true wild horse. There is an extensive, specialized vocabulary used to describe equine-related concepts, covering everything from anatomy to life stages, size, colors, markings, breeds, locomotion, and behavior. Black Cowboy, Wild Horses: A True Story is a 1998 children's picture book by Julius Lester and illustrator Jerry Pinkney. It is about an ex-slave and cowboy, Bob Lemmons, who, by himself, wrangles a herd of wild horses to a corral. The Corolla Wild Horses Protection Act ( ) is a bill that was introduced into the 113th United States Congress, where it passed the United States House of Representatives. The bill would affect wild horses living in North Carolina. Wild Horses is the debut studio album by the British rock band, Wild Horses, co-produced with Trevor Rabin at Konk Studios in London, and released on 14 April 1980 on EMI Records. It peaked at No. 38, and spent four weeks in the UK Albums Chart. Georgia Bruce (born 7 May 1981) is an expert in equine behavior and psychology. She specializes in the positive reinforcement based training method known as \"Clicker Training\". Bruce has written two books about clicker training horses and has also produced a DVD training series on equine clicker training. Bruce gives lessons, clinics, trick shows and clicker training demonstrations around Australia. Her broad repertoire of horse training skills includes training trick horses, liberty horses, wild horses, starting young horses and retraining problem horses. Bruce also has extensive experience training horses for high level performance in both dressage and reining. Stroh is a maker using Stroviols, as a trade name for their phono instruments, which include violin, viola, cello, bass, ukulele, slide guitar, and mandolin. There are also numerous Stroviols one string phonofiddles made. These instruments are named after their designer, John Matthias Augustus Stroh, an electrical engineer in London, who patented it. On 4 May 1899, Stroh applied for a UK patent, GB9418 titled \"Improvements in Violins and other Stringed Instruments\" which was accepted on 24 March 1900. This described the use of a flat metal (other materials are also mentioned) diaphragm in the voice-box (reproducer) of a violin to mechanically amplify the sound. Then on 16 February 1901 he applied for a second UK patent, GB3393 titled \"Improvements in the Diaphragms of Phonographs, Musical Instruments, and anologous Sound-producing, Recording and Transmitting Contrivances\". Which was accepted on 14 December 1901. This effectively extended the first concept to now use a conical resonator with corrugations at its edge, allowing a more 'rigid' diaphragm. His failure to register his inventions in the USA allowed John Dopyera and Geo Beauchamp to subsequently obtain US patents for the tricone and single cone designs used in National brand instruments. The Stroh violin is also closely related to other horned violins using a mica sheet-resonating diaphragm, known as phonofiddles. Dobro is a wood-bodied, single cone resonator guitar. Wild Horses is an American country music band composed of Lon Holland (accordion, percussion), Steve Kellough (bass guitar), Michael Blake Mahler (lead guitar, vocals), Ralph McCauley (drums), Angela Rae (lead vocals), and Chris Sigmon (Dobro). Mahler and Rae are husband and wife, and guitarist Joe Lee Koenig was formerly a member. A feral horse is a free-roaming horse of domesticated ancestry. As such, a feral horse is not a wild animal in the sense of an animal without domesticated ancestors. However, some populations of feral horses are managed as wildlife, and these horses often are popularly called \"wild\" horses. Feral horses are descended from domestic horses that strayed, escaped, or were deliberately released into the wild and remained to survive and reproduce there. Away from humans, over time, these animals' patterns of behavior revert to behavior more closely resembling that of wild horses. Some horses that live in a feral condition but may be occasionally handled or managed by humans, particularly if privately owned, are referred to as \"semi-feral\".\n\nQuestion:\nWhat kind of wood-bodied , single cone resonator instrument did a member of the Wild horses play?\n\nPlease give the answer directly without any explanation.", "results": "Dobro", "reasoning_chains": []}

During his administration, Murray constructed its present city hall, (essentially renovating Arlington Elementary School). He was noted for increasing Murray's presence in the arts, especially its sponsorship of the Murray Symphony Orchestra. He was also noted for his opposition of annexing then unincorporated Taylorsville, Utah into Murray which would have doubled its population. He was defeated in his re-election bid by Lavar McMillan. Murray, Utah was declared a city July 3, 1902, instituting a mayor-council form of government. The mayor of Murray was originally partisan, but switched to a non-partisan position. The term of mayor was originally two years, but amended to a four-year term in the 1940s in accordance with state law. The following is a list of Mayors of Murray, Utah. Joseph H. Stratton (September 1854 \u2013 1922) was elected mayor of Murray, Utah from 1904 to 1905. He was one of the first candidates for mayor of the new city, but was defeated by Chillion L. Miller.

The 1967 Detroit riot, also known as the 12th Street riot or the 1967 Detroit rebellion, was one of 159 race riots that swept cities in the United States during the \"Long Hot Summer of 1967\". This riot was a violent public disorder that turned into a civil disturbance in Detroit, Michigan. It began in the early morning hours of Sunday July 23, 1967. The precipitating event was a police raid of an unlicensed, after-hours bar then known as a \"blind pig,\" just north of the corner of 12th Street (today Rosa Parks Boulevard) and Virginia Park Avenue, on the city's Near West Side. Police confrontations with patrons and observers on the street evolved into one of the deadliest and most destructive riots in the history of the United States, lasting five days and surpassing the violence and property destruction of Detroit's 1943 race riot just 24 years earlier.

The incident was heavily publicized by leading Patriots, such as Paul Revere and Samuel Adams, to encourage rebellion against the British authorities. British troops had been stationed in Boston, capital of the Province of Massachusetts Bay, since 1768 in order to protect and support crown-appointed colonial officials attempting to enforce unpopular Parliamentary legislation. Amid ongoing tense relations between the population and the soldiers, a mob formed around a British sentry, who was subjected to verbal abuse and harassment. He was eventually supported by eight additional soldiers, who were subjected to verbal threats and repeatedly hit by clubs, stones and snowballs. They fired into the crowd, without orders, instantly killing three people and wounding others. Two more people died later of wounds sustained in the incident. Kevin Gerard Barry (20 January 1902 \u2013 1 November 1920) was the first Irish republican to be executed by the British since the leaders of the Easter Rising. Barry was sentenced to death for his part in an Irish Volunteers operation which resulted in the deaths of three British soldiers. The Massachusetts Circular Letter was a statement written by Samuel Adams and James Otis Jr., and passed by the Massachusetts House of Representatives in February 1768 in response to the Townshend Acts. Reactions to the letter brought heightened tensions between the British Parliament and Massachusetts, and resulted in the military occupation of Boston by the British Army, which contributed to the coming of the American Revolution. The Townshend Acts were a series of British acts passed beginning in 1767 and relating to the British American colonies in North America. The acts are named after Charles Townshend, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who proposed the program. Historians vary slightly as to which acts they include under the heading \"Townshend Acts\", but five acts are often mentioned: the Revenue Act of 1767, the Indemnity Act (1767), the Commissioners of Customs Act (1767), the Vice Admiralty Court Act (1768), and the New York Restraining Act (1767). The purpose of the Townshend Acts was to raise revenue in the colonies to pay the salaries of governors and judges so that they would remain loyal to Great Britain, to create a more effective means of enforcing compliance with trade regulations, to punish the province of New York for failing to comply with the 1765 Quartering Act, and to establish the precedent that the British Parliament had the right to tax the colonies. The Townshend Acts (1767) were met with resistance in the colonies, prompting the occupation of Boston by British troops in 1768, which eventually resulted in the Boston Massacre of 1770. The Drummuckavall Ambush was an attack by the South Armagh Brigade of the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) on a British Army observation post southeast of Crossmaglen, County Armagh, along the border with the Republic of Ireland. It occurred on 22 November 1975 and resulted in the deaths of three British soldiers. The Falls Curfew, also called the Battle of the Falls (or Lower Falls), was a British Army operation during 3\u20135 July 1970 in the Falls district of Belfast, Northern Ireland. The operation began as a search for weapons in the staunchly Irish nationalist district. As the search ended, local youths attacked the British soldiers with stones and petrol bombs and the soldiers responded with CS gas. This quickly developed into gun battles between British soldiers and the Irish Republican Army (IRA). After four hours of continuous clashes, the British commander sealed off the area, which comprised 3,000 homes, and imposed a curfew which would last for 36 hours. Thousands of British troops moved into the curfew zone and carried out house-to-house searches for weapons, while coming under intermittent attack from the IRA and rioters. The searches caused much destruction, and a large amount of CS gas was fired into the area. Many residents complained of suffering abuse at the hands of the soldiers. On 5 July, the curfew was brought to an end when thousands of women and children from Andersonstown marched into the curfew zone with food and groceries for the locals. \"The Quartering Act\" is a name given to a minimum of two Acts of British Parliament in the local governments of the American colonies to provide the British soldiers with any needed accommodations and housing. It also required colonists to provide food for any British soldiers in the area. Each of the \"Quartering Acts\" was an amendment to the Mutiny Act and required annual renewal by Parliament.William Winthrop, [Military Law and Precedents], (Government Printing Office 1920); \"Quartering Act.\" They were originally intended as a response to issues that arose during the French and Indian War and soon became a source of tension between the inhabitants of the Thirteen Colonies and the government in London, England. These tensions would later fuel the fire that led to the American Revolution. Prior to the American Revolution, the British began taxing American colonies to raise revenue. South Carolina residents were outraged about the 1767 Townshend Acts that taxed tea, paper, wine, glass, and lamp oil. To protest the earlier 1765 Stamp Act, South Carolina sent wealthy rice planter Thomas Lynch, 26-year-old lawyer John Rutledge, and Christopher Gadsden to the 1765 Stamp Act Congress, held in New York. Other taxes were removed in 1766, but tea taxes remained. Soon South Carolinians confiscated the tea that arrived at Charleston Harbor and stored it in the Exchange and Customs House. It was later sold to help pay for the Revolution. The Virginia Association was a series of non-importation agreements adopted by Virginians in 1769 as a way of speeding economic recovery and opposing the Townshend Acts. Drafted by George Mason and passed by the Virginia House of Burgesses in May 1769, the Virginia Association was a way for Virginians to stand united against continued British taxation and trade control. The Virginia Association served as the framework and precursor to the larger more powerful Continental Association. The Glenanne gang or Glenanne group was a secret informal alliance of Ulster loyalists, mostly from Northern Ireland, who carried out shooting and bombing attacks against Catholics and nationalists during the Troubles, beginning in the 1970s. Most of its attacks took place in the \"murder triangle\" area of counties Armagh and Tyrone. It also launched some attacks elsewhere in Northern Ireland and in the Republic of Ireland. The gang included British soldiers from the Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR), police officers from the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC), and members of the Mid-Ulster Brigade of the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF). Twenty-five British soldiers and police officers were named as purported members of the gang. Details about the group have come from many sources, including the affidavit of former member and RUC officer John Weir; statements by other former members; police, army and court documents; and ballistics evidence linking the same weapons to various attacks. Since 2003, the group's activities have also been investigated by the 2006 \"Cassel Report\", and three reports commissioned by Irish Supreme Court Justice Henry Barron, known as the \"Barron Reports\". A book focusing on the group's activities, \"Lethal Allies: British Collusion in Ireland\", was published in 2013. It drew on all the aforementioned sources, as well as Historical Enquiries Team investigations.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat consequence of the Townshend Acts resulted in the deaths of five people by British soldiers?\n\nPlease give the answer directly without any explanation.", "results": "The Boston Massacre", "reasoning_chains": []}

A number of songs were written by Warne, including the ballad \"Dutch Moon\". \"Norfolk Coast\" peaked at No. 70 in the UK Albums Chart in February, for one week's duration in that listing. \"Far East Man\" is a song written by English musicians George Harrison and Ronnie Wood, each of whom released a recording of the song in 1974. Wood's version appeared on \"I've Got My Own Album to Do\", his debut solo album, and Harrison's on \"Dark Horse\". Their only official songwriting collaboration, \"Far East Man\" is an affirmation of friendship in the face of life's obstacles and musically reflects the two guitarists' adoption of the soul genre. Written mostly by Harrison, the composition has been interpreted as a restatement of the humanitarian message expressed in his 1971 single \"Bangla Desh\", and a tribute to Indian musician Ravi Shankar.\n\nQuestion:\nOf the two English musicians, Baz Warne or Dave Wakeling, who was born first?\n\nPlease give the answer directly without any explanation.", "results": "Baz Warne", "reasoning_chains": []}

Something to Remember is a compilation album by American singer Madonna, released by Maverick Records on November 3, 1995. The album was conceived after a controversial period in Madonna's career, when many critics had speculated that her career had declined. It compiles ballads spanning over a decade of her career, including a reworked version of \"Love Don't Live Here Anymore\" and three new songs: \"You'll See\", \"One More Chance\" and a cover of Marvin Gaye's \"I Want You\". The album also features previously released singles that had never been included on a Madonna album, \"I'll Remember\" and \"This Used to Be My Playground\", and altogether provided a softer image for the singer during a critical period in her career. Madonna Louise Ciccone ( ; born August 16, 1958) is an American singer, songwriter, actress, and businesswoman. A leading presence during the emergence of MTV in the 1980s, Madonna is known for pushing the boundaries of lyrical content in mainstream popular music, as well as visual imagery in music videos and on stage. She has also frequently reinvented both her music and image while maintaining autonomy within the recording industry. Besides sparking controversy, her works have been acclaimed by music critics. Referred to as the \"Queen of Pop\", Madonna is widely cited as an influence by other artists. \"You'll See\" is a song by American singer Madonna from her ballads compilation, \"Something to Remember\" (1995). The album was released with the intention of toning down the image of Madonna, who was being heavily criticized at the time. She wrote and produced the song with Canadian musician David Foster. \"You'll See\" was released on October 30, 1995, by Maverick Records as the lead single from the album. An acoustic pop ballad, \"You'll See\" features instrumentation from percussion, tremolo guitar and piano, while lyrically it speaks of independence after the end of a love affair. \"This Used to Be My Playground\" is a song recorded by American singer Madonna. It is the theme for the film \"A League of Their Own\", which starred Madonna, and portrayed a fictionalized account of the real-life All-American Girls Professional Baseball League. Madonna was asked to record a song for the film's soundtrack. At that time she was busy recording her fifth studio album, \"Erotica\", with producer Shep Pettibone. They worked on some ideas and came up with \"This Used to Be My Playground\" in two days. Once presented to director Penny Marshall's team, the song was released as a standalone single on June 16, 1992, by Warner Bros. Records. However, it was not available on the film's soundtrack due to contractual obligations and was later added to the Olympics-inspired \"Barcelona Gold\" compilation album, released that summer. The song was included on Madonna's 1995 ballads compilation \"Something to Remember\". \"Rain\" is a song by American singer Madonna from her fifth studio album \"Erotica\" (1992). The song was released on July 6, 1993 by Maverick Records as the album's fifth single internationally and the fourth single in North America. It was later included on her ballad compilation album \"Something to Remember\" (1995). The song was written and produced by Madonna and Shep Pettibone. A pop ballad with influence from trip hop and new-age music, \"Rain\" features a more \"friendly\" composition than the other singles released from the album. Lyrically the song likens rain to the empowering effect of love, and as with water's ability to clean and wash away pain. Like the other songs on \"Erotica\", sexual contact is also a possible interpretation of the song. \"Oh Father\" is a song by American singer Madonna from her fourth studio album \"Like a Prayer\" (1989). It was released as the fourth single from the album on October 24, 1989 by Sire Records. The song was not released as a single in most European territories until December 24, 1995, when it appeared on the 1995 ballads compilation \"Something to Remember\". Written and produced by Madonna and Patrick Leonard, the nexus of \"Oh Father\" was the presence of male authoritative figures in Madonna's life, most prominently her father, Tony Ciccone. Madonna's relationship with her father had soured, after her mother's death in 1963 and his remarriage two years later. While developing the \"Like a Prayer\" album, Madonna was in an emotional state of mind due to her personal problems, which is reflected in \"Oh Father\". \"Take a Bow\" is a song by American singer Madonna from her sixth studio album \"Bedtime Stories\" (1994). It was released as the album's second single on November 29, 1994, by Maverick Records. It is a midtempo pop ballad written and produced by Madonna and Babyface. The song also appears on her compilation albums \"Something to Remember\" (1995), \"GHV2\" (2001) and \"Celebration\" (2009). Following the sexually explicit persona portrayed by Madonna on her previous album, \"Erotica\", the singer wanted to tone down her image for \"Bedtime Stories\". She started collaborating with Babyface, whose work with other musicians had impressed her. \"Take a Bow\" was developed from this collaboration, after Madonna listened to the beat and the chords of the demo structure of the song. \"Crazy for You\" is a song by American singer Madonna from the soundtrack album to the 1985 film \"Vision Quest\". It was released on March 2, 1985 by Geffen Records as the first single from the soundtrack. The song appears remixed on the greatest hits compilation \"The Immaculate Collection\" (1990) and was re-released on February 24, 1991 by Sire Records to promote the album. The song was also included on the ballads compilation \"Something to Remember\" (1995) and the greatest hits compilation \"Celebration\" (2009). Producers Jon Peters and Peter Guber, along with music director Phil Ramone, decided to use Madonna after listening to her previous recordings, employing John Bettis and Jon Lind to write the song. After reading the script of the film, Bettis and Lind wrote the song about the situation in which the lead characters meet at a nightclub. Initial recording sessions did not impress Bettis and Lind, and they felt that \"Crazy for You\" would be dropped from the soundtrack. However, a new version was recorded to their liking.\n\nQuestion:\nSomething to Remember was a compilation album by the American singer who was a presence on what new television station in the 1980s?\n\nPlease give the answer directly without any explanation.", "results": "MTV", "reasoning_chains": []}

New teams to the division included Lydney who were relegated from 2003\u201304 National Division Two as well as Havant (champions) and Hertford (playoffs) who were promoted from London Division 1 while Reading came up as champions of South West Division 1. The season would also see the introduction of a new points system with 4 points being awarded for a win, 2 points being awarded for a draw (replacing the old system of 2 points for a win and 1 for a draw) with the addition of a bonus point being given for scoring 4 or more tries as well as a bonus point given if you manage to lose a game within 7 points of the victorious team. In terms of promotion the league champions would go straight up into National Division Two while the runners up would have a one game playoff against the runners up from National Division Three North (at the home ground of the club with the superior league record) for the final promotion place. Huddersfield Town's 2010\u201311 campaign was Huddersfield Town's seventh consecutive season in the third tier of English football. After losing to Millwall in the play-offs in the previous season, many hoped that Town would gain promotion to the Football League Championship this season. After finishing in 3rd place with a club record of 87 points, the Terriers lost the play-off final at Old Trafford, by 3-0 against Peterborough United, meaning that they would stay in League One for another season. The 2008\u201309 National Division Three North was the tenth and last season (twenty-second overall) of the fourth division (north) of the English domestic rugby union competition using the name National Division Three North.

Peter Allan Jackson (born 6 April 1961 in Bradford, England) is a football manager and former footballer. He has previously had two spells as Huddersfield Town manager, whom he helped win the Division Three play-off in 2004, and he has also managed Lincoln City, before taking charge at his former playing club Bradford City in 2011. The 1997\u201398 season was a disaster turned into a success for Huddersfield Town. After a closed season of little activity in the transfer market, Town started the 1997\u201398 season disastrously and, after some questionable signings and tactical decisions, Brian Horton was sacked in October 1997 as the club lay at the foot of Division One. Thirty-six-year-old former Huddersfield, Bradford City and Newcastle United central defender Peter Jackson was drafted in as Horton's replacement in October and turned the club's fortunes around drastically. He immediately installed the experienced former Wales manager Terry Yorath as his assistant. Given a generous transfer budget by the board, Jackson captured experienced pros such as former Welsh internationals Barry Horne and David Phillips in addition to powerful local-born striker Wayne Allison from Division 1 rivals Swindon Town. He also managed to rejuvenate players such as Marcus Stewart and, particularly, the previously inconsistent Paul Dalton to the extent that the club finished a respectable 16th in the final table.\n\nQuestion:\nWho was hired into Huddersfield Town's football club in 1997, and helped them win the Division Three play-off in 2004?\n\nPlease give the answer directly without any explanation.", "results": "Peter Jackson", "reasoning_chains": []}

Founded in 1999, it was the fourth Honda automotive venture in India, after Kinetic Honda Motor Ltd (1984-1998), Hero Honda (1984-2011) and Honda Siel Cars India (1995-2012). HMSI was established in 1999 at Manesar, District Gurgaon, Haryana. The American Honda Motor Company, Inc. (sometimes abbreviated as AHM) is a North American subsidiary of the Honda Motor Company, Ltd. It was founded in 1959. The company combines product sales, service and coordinating functions of Honda in North America, and is responsible for distribution, marketing and sales of Honda and Acura brand automobiles, Honda power sports products, including motorcycles, scooters and all-terrain vehicles, and Honda power equipment products, including lawnmowers, tillers, string trimmers, snow blowers, generators, small displacement general-purpose engines and marine outboard engines. Mugen Motorsports (M-TEC Co., Ltd) (\u7121\u9650) is a Japanese company formed in 1973 by Hirotoshi Honda, the son of Honda Motor Company founder Soichiro Honda, and Masao Kimura. Mugen, meaning \"Without Limit\", \"Unlimited\" or \"Vast\", (hence the commonly placed word \"Power\" after, denoting \"Unlimited Power\") is an engine tuner and parts manufacturer that manufactures OEM parts such as body kits and sports exhausts for Honda Motor Company. Despite the family connections, however, Mugen is not, and has never been, owned by Honda Motor Company; Mugen owner Hirotoshi Honda has been the major shareholder in Honda since his father's death in 1991. CVCC is a trademark by the Honda Motor Company for an engine with reduced automotive emissions, which stood for \"Compound Vortex Controlled Combustion\". The first mention of Honda developed CVCC technology was done by Mr. Soichiro Honda February 12, 1971, at the Federation of Economic Organizations Hall in Otemachi, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo. Honda's engineers at the time, Mr. Date conferred with Mr. Yagi and Mr. Nakagawa about the possibility of creating lean combustion via a prechamber, which some diesel engines utilized. The first engine to be installed with the CVCC approach for testing was the single-cylinder, 300 cc Honda EA engine used in the Honda N600 hatchback in January 1970. This technology allowed Honda's cars to meet Japanese and United States emission standards in the 1970s without a catalytic converter. A type of stratified charge engine, it first appeared on the 1975 \"ED1\" engine. As emission laws advanced and required more stringent admissible levels, Honda abandoned the CVCC method and introduced PGM-FI, or Programmed Fuel Injection on all Honda vehicles. Some vehicles in Japan had a combination of electronically controlled carburetors, called PGM-Carb on specific, transitional Honda D, E and ZC engines. Honda Aero, Inc.

The island consists of Cape May, Cape May Point, West Cape May and portions of Lower Township. The island is separated from the mainland and the rest of Cape May County by the Cape May Canal, Cape Island Creek and Cape May Harbor which cut it off from the rest of the Cape May Peninsula. A spring creek is a type of free flowing river whose name derives from its origin: an underground spring or set of springs which produces sufficient water to consistently feed a unique river. The water flowing in a spring creek may additionally be fed by snow pack or rain run-off, as in most traditional free-flowing rivers, but often the entire water source for a spring creek is an aquifer or other underground water source. For this reason, spring creeks are often filled with very pure, clean water and also demonstrate water flows that are smooth, consistent, and unwavering throughout the seasons of the year - unlike rivers filled with run-off or spring and summer melt-off from snow pack, whose water flows, water clarity, and water conditions often vary highly over the course of the year. In addition, water temperatures in spring creeks tend to vary less throughout the seasons of the year than traditional creeks and rivers because they are fed by underground water sources. Because of the depths of these water sources, spring creeks often emerge from their source or headwaters very cold and stay that way over the length of their runs. In addition, due to the consistent water flows and the fact that spring creek water is \"pushed\" by the force of pressure from the source rather than \"pulled\" by the force of gravity downhill, spring creeks can flow through very flat sections of land with minimal depths over grades that might not sustain run-off creeks and rivers. In these low-grade or flat sections of spring creeks, water flows can appear almost laminar with the surface of the creek appearing to be nearly flat and without the prominent riffles and surface disturbances caused by more rough or uneven surface bottoms found below free-stone run-off creeks and rivers surfaces. Bald Eagle State Park is a 5900 acre Pennsylvania state park in Howard, Liberty, and Marion townships in Centre County, Pennsylvania in the United States. The park includes the Foster Joseph Sayers Reservoir, formed by damming Bald Eagle Creek and other smaller streams and covering 1730 acre . Bald Eagle State Park is at the meeting point of two distinct geologic features. The Allegheny Plateau is to the north and the Ridge and Valley area of Pennsylvania is to the south. The park is in the Bald Eagle Valley off Pennsylvania Route 150 in Howard, between Milesburg and Lock Haven. Bald Eagle is an unincorporated populated place in Blair County, Pennsylvania, United States. It is located in the Bald Eagle Valley at the foot of the Bald Eagle Mountain ridge, along the Big Fill Run near its confluence with the headwaters of the Bald Eagle Creek tributary of the Little Juniata River. Originally a stop on the Pennsylvania Railroad Tyrone Division, it is now exit 52 off of Interstate 99, and was the former northern terminus of the unfinished highway. The Bald Eagle post office zip code is 16686. The Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act (16 U.S.C. 668-668d) is a United States federal statute that protects two species of eagle. The bald eagle was chosen as a national emblem of the United States by the Continental Congress of 1782 and was given legal protection by the Bald Eagle Protection Act of 1940. This act was expanded to include the golden eagle in 1962. Since the original Act, the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act has been amended several times. It currently prohibits anyone, without a permit issued by the Secretary of the Interior, from \"taking\" bald eagles. Taking is described to include their parts, nests, or eggs, molesting or disturbing the birds. The Act provides criminal penalties for persons who \"take, possess, sell, purchase, barter, offer to sell, purchase or barter, transport, export or import, at any time or any manner, any bald eagle ... [or any golden eagle], alive or dead, or any part, nest, or egg thereof.\" The Cape May Canal is a 2.9-nautical mile (3.3 mi; 5.4 km) waterway connecting Cape May Harbor to the Delaware Bay, at the southern tip of Cape May County, New Jersey. There is a long history of unfulfilled plans for a canal across Cape May. The canal was finally constructed by the United States Army Corps of Engineers during World War II to provide a protected route to avoid German U-boats operating off Cape May Point and to become part of the Intracoastal Waterway. The canal was dredged as a wartime emergency measure in 1942 and was the final link in a protected waterway intended to allow coastal shipping to travel along the coast with a greatly reduced risk of attack from German submarines. The Nittany Valley is an eroded anticlinal valley in the central portion of Centre County, Pennsylvania in the United States. It is separated from the Bald Eagle Valley by Bald Eagle Mountain and from Penns Valley by Mount Nittany. The valley is closed to the north by a high plateau that joins these two mountain ridges, but is open to the south at the southern terminus of Mount Nittany. The valley drains to the Bald Eagle Creek through water gaps in Bald Eagle Mountain formed by Spring Creek, and Fishing Creek, along with smaller streams running through Curtain Gap and Howard Gap. The Northwest side of the valley between the Bald Eagle Mountain ridge and the lower Sand Ridge is also known as the \"Little Nittany Valley\". Route 109 is a 3.06 mi state highway located in Cape May County, New Jersey, United States. The route runs from Jackson Street in Cape May north to an intersection with U.S. Route 9 (US 9) in Lower Township. It crosses one of two road bridges over the Cape May Canal (the other is Route 162) and provides access to the southern end of the Garden State Parkway and County Route 621 (Ocean Drive) as well as to Cape May. Only the section of road in Lower Township is state maintained; the rest is maintained by Cape May County and signed as County Route 633, which extends 0.34 mi past the southern terminus along Jackson Street and Perry Street to County Route 626 in West Cape May. The Bald Eagle and Spring Creek Navigation Company was a canal company in central Pennsylvania intended to link the iron industry of Bellefonte, Pennsylvania, with the Pennsylvania canal system. Opened for half its length in 1837, the remainder of the canal was not completed until 1848. Destroyed by flooding in 1865, it was not rebuilt; a paralleling railroad completed that year replaced it.

The North American leg constituted band leader Paul McCartney's first live performances there since the Beatles' final tour, in 1966, and the only time that Wings played in the US and Canada. The world tour was well-attended and critically acclaimed, and resulted in a triple live album, \"Wings Over America\", which Capitol Records released in December 1976. In addition, the tour was documented in the television film \"Wings Over the World\" (1979) and a cinema release, \"Rockshow\" (1980). Back to the Egg is the seventh and final studio album by the British-American band Wings, released in 1979 on Columbia Records in America, and on Parlophone in the UK. Co-produced by Chris Thomas, the album reflects band leader Paul McCartney's embracing of contemporary musical trends such as new wave and punk, and marked the arrival of new Wings members Laurence Juber and Steve Holley. \"Back to the Egg\" adopts a loose conceptual theme around the idea of a working band, and its creation coincided with a period of considerable activity for the group, which included making a return to touring and work on several television and film projects. Rockshow is a 1980 concert film by Paul McCartney and Wings, filmed during the band's 1976 North American tour. The film features 30 songs from four concerts of the tour: New York, on 25 May (four songs); Seattle, Washington, 10 June (five songs); and Los Angeles, California, 22 June (fifteen songs) and 23 June (six songs). Both the cover of the home video release and McCartney himself in his intro to \"The McCartney Years\" DVD acknowledge only the Seattle concert, however. These concerts were part of the 1975\u201376 Wings Over the World tour, which also produced the triple live album \"Wings over America\" (1976) and the \"Wings Over the World\" television documentary (1979). \"Mull of Kintyre\" is a song by the British-American rock band Wings written by Paul McCartney and Denny Laine. The song was written in tribute to the picturesque Kintyre peninsula in Scotland and its headland, the Mull of Kintyre, where McCartney has owned High Park Farm since 1966. The song was Wings' biggest hit in Britain where it became the 1977 Christmas number one, and was the first single to sell over two million copies nationwide. College Concert is the twelfth album by the American folk music group the Kingston Trio, released in 1962 (see 1962 in music).

Mulennium is a live release by the band Gov't Mule. The release includes all three sets from the band's December 31, 1999/January 1, 2000 New Year's Eve show at the Roxy Theatre in Atlanta, Georgia, USA. The band had headlined the same venue exactly one year before, which resulted in their second live album \"Live... With a Little Help from Our Friends\". Unlike that release, which came out within a year of the actual concert, \"Mulennium\" was not released until 2010. Wings over America is a triple live album by Wings, released in December 1976. The album was recorded during American leg of the band's acclaimed 1975\u201376 Wings Over the World tour.

It was originally released on the album \"Venus and Mars\". It was performed throughout their world tours in Australia and America and a live version was included on the album \"Wings Over America\". It was also included on the compilation album \"\". The song was also included on the theatrical version of the film \"Rockshow\", documenting the Wings 1976 tour, but was excluded from the laserdisc version of the film. Wings Over the World is a 1979 television documentary film featuring the rock band Wings. It consists of concert performances from their acclaimed 1975\u201376 world tour, together with behind-the-scenes footage. Also included is a short excerpt of Wings rehearsing at London's Institute of Contemporary Arts before their 1972 UK university tour. Problems with the audio from the 1976 live performances delayed the film's release until March 16, 1979 in the United States (on CBS) and April 8, 1979 in the United Kingdom (on BBC2), by which time, band members Jimmy McCulloch and Joe English had left the group and been replaced. \"Beware My Love\" is a song credited to Paul and Linda McCartney that was first released on the Wings 1976 album \"Wings at the Speed of Sound\". It was also used as the B-side of the single that included \"Let 'Em In\". A live version recorded on June 7, 1976, in Denver, Colorado, was included on the Wings' album \"Wings Over America\" and another live version from three days later in Seattle, Washington, was shown in the concert film \"Rockshow\".

The Sands Ring Homestead Museum is a historic house located on Main Street in the Town of Cornwall, in Orange County, New York. It was built in 1760 by Nathaniel Sands for his cousin Comfort Sands. Comfort\u2019s wife, however, did not want to leave her home on Long Island, so Nathaniel and his family moved in. In 1777, Nathaniel gave the house as a wedding present to his son David and his bride Clementine Hallock. David, a member of the Society of Friends, opened the house to the Quaker community as a meetinghouse until the Quaker Meeting House located at 60 Quaker Avenue opened in 1790. His son David established a store on the site. It was one of the first meeting places of the Cornwall Quakers. Today it is used as museum featuring Colonial-era activities. The William W. Early House is a Queen Anne-style house located at Brandywine in Prince George's County, Maryland, United States, and is privately owned. It was constructed in 1907. According to a 1989 Historic American Buildings Survey report on the house, \"The William W. Early House is probably the best example of turn-of-the-century Queen Anne-style domestic architecture in the county.\" Holly Hall is a historic home located at Elkton, Cecil County, Maryland. Built by James Sewall ca. 1810-20, it is a 2\u00a0\u2044 -story, Federal-style brick mansion built about 1810. The one-story brick north wing was added as a chapel in the 20th century. Also on the property is a late-19th-century two-story wood tenant house and two concrete block buildings. A few holly trees remain of the many which gave this house its name. Its parapets are unique in Maryland. The Capt. Henry E. Sewall House is an historic wooden house now located in Indian RiverSide Park in Jensen Beach, in Martin County, Florida. Local pioneer and developer Capt. Henry E. Sewall built it in 1889 at the southern tip of Sewall's Point, the peninsula and town which bear his family name. When Capt. Sewall became the postmaster of Sewall's Point, the house served also as the Sewall's Point post office. Next to the house Capt. Sewall also built a freight dock that extended into the St. Lucie River along with a storage building at its end. Island Falls is a town in Aroostook County, Maine, United States. The population was 837 at the 2010 census. Island Falls took its name from an island in the stream at the verge of a waterfall. Haphazard is a historic house located on Pleasant Valley Road in Owensboro, Kentucky. The house overlooks the Ohio River, and its name is probably derived from the river's eddies. The property which Haphazard was built on was originally owned by George Mason, a signatory to the U.S. Constitution, who was given the land in a grant surveyed in 1787. Mason's grandson Richard sold the property to Robert Triplett in 1822, by which point the log house forming the central portion of the home had been built. Triplett likely added the house's side wings, northern gable, and Federal style interior. Triplett accomplished many local firsts, as he was Owensboro's first large real estate dealer; Daviess County's first soil conservationist, barge operator, and author; the first distiller on the Ohio River in the county; and the builder of Kentucky's first railroad. In 1843, A. B. Barret purchased the house from Triplett; Barret then sold the house to William Bell the following year. Bell, the president of a local bank, likely added the house's Greek Revival portico. The Belmont-Paul Women's Equality National Monument (formerly the Sewall House (1800\u20131929), Alva Belmont House (1929\u20131972), and the Sewall-Belmont House and Museum (1972\u20132016)) is a historic house and museum of the U.S. women's suffrage and equal rights movements located in the Capitol Hill neighborhood of Washington, D.C.. The monument is named after suffragists and National Woman's Party leaders Alva Belmont and Alice Paul. Carroll Place, also known as Old Carroll Place, is a historic plantation house located near St. George, Dorchester County, South Carolina. Research completed circa 2012 at the South Carolina Archives in Columbia S.C. shows the house was built circa 1780, and is a plain two-story, Georgian I-house dwelling. It is sheathed in clapboard single house and rests upon low brick pillars. It has a hip roofed verandah supported by six wooden posts. Its builder was likely Thomas Ferguson or David Campbell. In 2008 the house was donated to the Dorchester County Historical Society by current owners Fitzhugh Lee Sweatman Jr and his wife, Martha Westbury-Sweatman. The Dorchester County Historical Society under took an extensive restoration of the Colonial Era Plantation House and when completed, re-designated the house as the Koger-Murray-Carroll house for three of its previous owners who served in the South Carolina General Assembly: Joseph Koger (married the daughter of David Campbell and inherited the house on her death), Soule Murray (purchased the house and land from Joseph Koger), and James Parsons Carroll (purchased the property circa 1850). James Parsons Carroll also served in the South Carolina Court of Equity as a Chancellor and was a signer of the South Carolina Ordinance of Secession.

This was Lake Placid's second time hosting the championships after having done so at the 1932 Winter Olympics. It also marked the first time after World War II the event took place after the Winter Olympics in a non-Olympic year (St. Moritz, Switzerland hosted the 1948 Winter Olympics two years earlier), the second time the world championships occurred outside Europe, the first time they had occurred outside Europe in a non-Olympic year, and the only time the United States has hosted the event in a non-Olympic year. The ski-jumping events were held at Lake Placid, while the cross-country skiing events (originally planned to also be held at Lake Placid) were moved to Rumford due to insufficient snow.

They represented Canada at the 1980 Winter Olympics, where they placed 9th, and at the 1984 Winter Olympics, where they placed 7th. In 2009, she was named to the World Figure Skating Hall of Fame. For the Summer and Winter Olympics, there are 27 venues that have been or will be used for figure skating. This is one of two sports in the Winter Olympics to debut in the Summer Olympics with ice hockey being the other. The first venue for the event took place during the 1908 Games was held indoors. Twelve years later, the venue joined ice hockey as another Winter Olympic sport in the Summer Olympics. For the first two Winter Olympics, figure skating was held outdoors. With figure skating being held outdoors, there were weather concerns with thawing for the first two Winter Games. A suggestion by International Olympic Committee President Count Henri de Baillet-Latour to 1932 Olympic Organizing Committee President Godfrey Dewey in September 1930 led Dewey to create the first indoor arena for the Winter Olympics. For the 1936 Games, the venue was covered partially. Following World War II, the 1948 venue became the first venue to be used twice at the Winter Olympics since it had been used twenty years earlier. Figure skating's final competition that took place outdoors was in 1956 though that venue has since had a roof added to it. Since 1960, all figure skating competitions have taken place indoors. Three National Hockey League (NHL) venues have hosted Olympic figure skating competitions: the 1988 (both venues) and the 2010 though the NHL Vancouver Canucks moved out of the 2010 venue following the 1994\u201395 season.

For the Summer and Winter Olympics, there are 46 venues that have been or will be used for ice hockey. The 46 venues are the most for any Winter Olympic sport. The first venue ice hockey took place in was indoor during the \"Summer\" Olympics in 1920. Twelve years later, ice hockey was held both indoors and outdoors. The plan was to have two of the twelve matches for those games played indoors, but thawing ice at the outdoor venue for those games forced four of the outdoor games to be moved indoors in 1932. Despite the success of indoor ice hockey venues at the 1932 Winter Olympics, it would be twenty years before another indoor venue would be used. Ice hockey would not be indoors entirely until the 1964 Games where they have remained as of the 2010 Winter Olympics. Both venues for the 2014 Winter Olympics are constructed to be indoors.

It was released by Relativity Records as a single with \"Fried Chicken\" as its b-side. The song \"Hellraiser\" is found on The Beatnuts' first full-length album \"\", but the remix was only released as a single. The remix is produced by The Beatnuts and features raps by JuJu, Psycho Les and Fashion. Its lyrics are mainly about violent braggadocios threats. It contains a slow and instrumental that matches the nature of its lyrics. \"Hellraiser (Remix)\" failed to chart and is one of the rarer Beatnuts singles. Memphis rap, also known as Memphis hip hop and in some forms Memphis horrorcore, is a regional subgenre of hip hop music that originated in Memphis, Tennessee in the early 1990s. The genre is characterized by its often low budget, repetitive production and its occasional lo-fi sound that also heavily utilizes the Roland TR-808 drum machine and minimal synth melodies, as well as double time flows and samples ranging from soul and funk to horror film scores, as well as hooks from songs by related rappers in the same genre, although DIY production without sampling is common as well. Beatnuts Forever is the second of three greatest hits albums by hip hop group The Beatnuts. It was released by Relativity Records in 2001 shortly after the release of \"Take It or Squeeze It\". It contains songs from The Beatnuts' first four albums, as well as its two EP's. It most heavily borrows from \"Take It or Squeeze It\" and least heavily from \"\". The album does not feature the song \"Beatnuts Forever\", and only contains one exclusive Beatnuts track, \"Intro\". All of its songs are produced by The Beatnuts. \"Beatnuts Forever\" did not chart upon release, and is currently out of print and rare.

East Coast hip hop is a regional subgenre of hip hop music that originated in the New York City area during the 1970s. Hip hop is recognized to have originated and evolved first in New York; East Coast hip hop only became a distinct subgenre after artists from other regions of the United States emerged with different styles. In contrast to other styles, East Coast hip hop music has prioritized complex lyrics for attentive listening rather than beats for dancing. The main components of hip hop culture from that time and still today are MC'ing, DJ'ing, break dancing, and graffiti. Hip hop or hip-hop is a subculture and art movement developed in South Bronx in New York City during the late 1970s. While people unfamiliar with hip hop culture often use the expression \"hip hop\" to refer exclusively to hip hop music (also called \"rap\"), Hip hop is characterized by nine distinct elements or expressive realms, of which hip hop music is only four elements (rapping, djaying, beatboxing and breaking). Afrika Bambaataa of the hip hop collective Zulu Nation outlined the pillars of hip hop culture, coining the terms: \"rapping\" (also called MCing or emceeing), a rhythmic vocal rhyming style (orality); DJing (and turntablism), which is making music with record players and DJ mixers (aural/sound and music creation); b-boying/b-girling/breakdancing (movement/dance); and graffiti art, which he called \"aerosol writin'\", although many say that the graffiti that hip hop adopted had been around years earlier, and had nothing to do with hip hop culture. (visual art). Other elements of hip hop subculture and arts movements beyond the main four are: hip hop culture and historical knowledge of the movement (intellectual/philosophical); beatboxing, a percussive vocal style; street entrepreneurship; hip hop language; and hip hop fashion and style, among others. Hip hop music, also called hip-hop or rap music, is a music genre developed in the United States by inner-city African Americans in the 1970s which consists of a stylized rhythmic music that commonly accompanies rapping, a rhythmic and rhyming speech that is chanted. It developed as part of hip hop culture, a subculture defined by four key stylistic elements: MCing/rapping, DJing/scratching with turntables, break dancing, and graffiti writing. Other elements include sampling beats or bass lines from records (or synthesized beats and sounds), and rhythmic beatboxing. While often used to refer solely to rapping, \"hip hop\" more properly denotes the practice of the entire subculture. The term \"hip hop music\" is sometimes used synonymously with the term \"rap music\", though rapping is not a required component of hip hop music; the genre may also incorporate other elements of hip hop culture, including DJing, turntablism, scratching, beatboxing, and instrumental tracks.\n\nQuestion:\n \"Here's a Drink\" is a single by The Beatnuts, a group in  regional subgenre of hip hop music that originated in the area of what city?\n\nPlease give the answer directly without any explanation.", "results": "New York City", "reasoning_chains": []}

A phone log is metadata collected from telephone or mobile phones for the purpose of surveillance or espionage. This metadata may include: length of calls, phone numbers of both parties, phone-specific identification information, gps location, call proximity, and/or computer converted voice-to-text transcripts of the phone call conversation. The advantage of converting audio to ASCII text metadata is that it makes it easily searchable for keywords and phrases, and is easily storeable for long periods of time on conventional database systems for years. Phone logs are not limited to governmental collection. For example, some private sector companies, such as banks, are known to collect phone log data on their internal phone network of all calls within and between the company and outside parties.

The 2003\u201304 Dayton Flyers men's basketball team represented the University of Dayton during the 2003\u201304 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. The Flyers, led by first year head coach Brian Gregory, played their home games at the University of Dayton Arena and were members of the Atlantic 10 Conference. They finished the season 24\u20139, 12\u20134 in A-10 play, finishing first in the A-10's West division. Dayton opened the season winning the Maui Invitational. The Flyers advanced to the finals of the Atlantic 10 Tournament where they were defeated by rival Xavier. Dayton received an at-large bid to the NCAA Tournament, the program's first consecutive NCAA appearances since the 1960s. The Flyers lost to DePaul in the first round. The 2010\u201311 Dayton Flyers men's basketball team represented the University of Dayton in the 2010\u201311 college basketball season. This was head coach Brian Gregory's eighth season at Dayton. The Flyers compete in the Atlantic 10 Conference and played their home games at the University of Dayton Arena. They finished the season 22\u201314, 7\u20139 in A-10 play and lost the championship game of the 2011 Atlantic 10 Men's Basketball Tournament, which hurt their chances to get to the 2011 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament. Instead they were invited to the 2011 National Invitation Tournament which they lost in the first round. The 2015 Buffalo Bills season was the franchise\u2019s 56th overall season as a football team, 46th in the National Football League, third under leadership of general manager Doug Whaley and first under new head coach Rex Ryan, who signed a five-year, $27.5 million contract on January 12, 2015 after having previously spent the past six seasons coaching the division-rival New York Jets, leading them to two straight AFC Championship games in 2009 and 2010, becoming the franchise\u2019s 18th head coach and the fifth in the past seven years in the process. Ryan replaced Doug Marrone, who opted out of his contract on December 31, 2014 to take advantage of a contract loophole, fearing the Pegulas were going to fire him, hence the reason the Bills entered the 2015 season looking for a new head coach. Despite the bold prediction made by Ryan at his introductory press conference, where he stated, \u201cI\u2019m not going to let our fans down. I am not going to do that. I know it\u2019s been 15 years since the Bills made the playoffs. Well, get ready, man, we\u2019re going. We are going,\u201d the Bills were unable to make the playoffs in their first season with Ryan as head coach, finishing with a record of 8-8 (the team\u2019s first since 2002), making it the 16th straight season without a playoff appearance, which became the longest active in major professional sports after Major League Baseball\u2019s Toronto Blue Jays broke their 22-year playoff drought on September 25, 2015. It was also the first full season under the ownership of Terry and Kim Pegula (whom also own the Buffalo Sabres), having purchased the Bills partway through 2014 after the death of longtime owner Ralph Wilson in March at the age of 95. The Bills began their season with an open competition for the starting quarterback position after Kyle Orton, the starter for most of the 2014 campaign, retired during the offseason, so the team acquired free agent Tyrod Taylor, a former backup quarterback of the Baltimore Ravens, who won the competition over incumbent second-string quarterback EJ Manuel and trade acquisition Matt Cassel, the latter of whom the team later traded along with a seventh-round pick in 2017 to the Dallas Cowboys, in exchange for a fifth-round draft pick in 2017.

R. R. Tolkien constructed many Elvish languages. These were the languages spoken by the tribes of his Elves. Tolkien was a philologist by profession, and spent much time on his constructed languages. The Elvish languages were the first thing he imagined for his secondary world. Tolkien said that his stories grew out of his languages. Tolkien also created scripts for his Elvish languages, of which the best known are the Sarati, the Tengwar, and the Cirth. The Man Booker International Prize is an international hosted in the United Kingdom. The introduction of the International Prize to complement the Man Booker Prize was announced in June 2004. Sponsored by the Man Group, from 2005 until 2015 the award was given every two years to a living author of any nationality for a body of work published in English or generally available in English translation. It rewarded one author's \"continued creativity, development and overall contribution to fiction on the world stage\", and was a recognition of the writer's body of work rather than any one title. The judges for the year compiled their own lists of authors, and submissions were not invited. Ilkorin (plural \"Ilkorindi\") is a Quenya word, literally meaning \"not of K\u00f4r\". The Ilkorindi were a group of Elves from J. R. R. Tolkien's fictional universe. They first appear in \"The Book of Lost Tales\". It was then a name with a broad meaning for all the Elves who \"never saw the light of K\u00f4r\" and also for their many tongues. K\u00f4r was the Quenya name for a hill and the city built on it, near the shores of the Bay of Faery. Liewe Heksie (Afrikaans for \"Beloved Little Witch\") is an Afrikaans work of fiction created by children's book author Verna Vels in 1961. It centres on Liewe Heksie, a rather incompetent and forgetful witch, who lives with her friends the elves in \"Blommeland\" and whose foolishness and lack of magic skills leads to many funny situations. The \"Liewe Heksie\" series started off as radio stories, followed by books and stories on vinyl record. \"Liewe Heksie\" made a television debut in 1978 as an Afrikaans language children's television programme, directed by well-known children's program writer and director Louise Smit. A second series of \"Liewe Heksie\" followed in 1981, for a total of 52 television programs. In the fictional Forgotten Realms setting, the intelligent species are classified into groups known as \"races\", which, in this context, generally refers to an intelligent species, such as humanity, elves or goblins. Within the setting, many of these races are traditionally grouped into one of two categories: the created races, such as the Yuan-ti, who have artificial, magical origins, and the creator races, such as humans and sarrukh, who are of uncertain origin, and are known to have made several created races, however some races don't fall into either category. The Real L Word is an American reality television series aired on the cable station Showtime, where it premiered on June 20, 2010. The show was created by executive producer Ilene Chaiken and Magical Elves Productions, following the success of the television drama \"The L Word\" also created by Chaiken. \"The Real L Word\" follows a group of lesbians in their daily lives in Los Angeles, and as of the third season, Brooklyn. The Death Gate Cycle is a seven-part series (heptalogy) of fantasy novels written by Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman. The main conflict is between two powerful races, the Sartan and the Patryns, which branched off from humans following a nuclear/anti-matter holocaust. Centuries prior to the events of the series, the Sartan attempted to end the conflict by sundering the Earth into four elemental realms, and imprisoning the Patryns in a fifth prison world, the Labyrinth. The Sartan took up stewardship of the elemental realms, but soon mysteriously lost contact with each other and disappeared. Centuries later, a Patryn known as Xar escaped the Labyrinth, and started returning to the Labyrinth to rescue others. He learned how to access the other worlds and dreamed of freeing all his people from the Labyrinth and conquering the other worlds. The books follow the fiercely independent Haplo, a Patryn agent sent to scout the elemental worlds and throw them into chaos in preparation for his Lord's conquest of them. Weis and Hickman created five distinct fantasy worlds during the course of the series, along with developing the cultures of five major races: the unique Patryn and Sartan, and the common fantasy races of dwarves, elves, and humans. Lego Elves (sometimes called Elves for short, and stylized mostly as LEGO Elves) is a toy line and its accompanying media franchise, created by Danish company Lego or The Lego Group, that began in 2015. It is part of the company's effort to make the brand more appealing to girls. Afterwards, it began to become a web-show webisode series in 2015, with a special sort-of-\"short-movie\" titled \"\"Unite the Magic\"\" on the LEGO YouTube channel, and on Netflix.

Prescott was laid out in 1873, after the railroad was built through the area that is now Nevada County, and the railroad has played a significant role in the city's development. The railroad today bisects the commercial core of the city, which extends for several city blocks away from the railroad. The historic district includes all of the major civic buildings of the city, including the courthouse, post office, and the old Prescott City Jail. CSX Transportation (reporting mark CSXT) is a Class I railroad in the United States. The main subsidiary of the CSX Corporation, the railroad is headquartered in Jacksonville, Florida, and owns about 21,000 route miles (34,000 km). CSX operates one of the three Class I railroads serving most of the East Coast, the other two being the Norfolk Southern Railway (NS) and Canadian Pacific Railway. It also serves the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec. Together CSX and Norfolk Southern Railway have a duopoly over all east-west freight rail traffic east of the Mississippi River. As of August 8, 2017, CSX's total public stock value was slightly over $41.5 billion. The Perth Amboy and Woodbridge Railroad was a railroad operated by the Pennsylvania Railroad. The main line began along the Pennsy main at Rahway, New Jersey. The line was only 6 miles long and was electrified in the year 1935. The line ended at the now closed Essay Tower in South Amboy, New Jersey. The rail line was double tracked and was used for both freight and passenger service. At Essay it would become the New York and Long Branch Railroad which would run to Bay Head Junction. At Essay traffic from the main or the South Amboy engine facility to the holding track outside the station. Essay also controlled traffic on the Camden and Amboy Railroad today known as the Amboy Secondary Track. Glen Riddle station was a commuter rail station on the SEPTA Regional Rail R3 West Chester Line, located underneath the South Pennell Road (PA-452) overpass in Middletown Twp, Pennsylvania. Originally built by the West Chester and Philadelphia Railroad, it later served the Pennsylvania Railroad's West Chester Branch, which finally became SEPTA's R3 line. Wawa station is a defunct commuter rail station on the SEPTA Regional Rail R3 West Chester Line, located to U.S. Route 1 in Chester Heights, Pennsylvania. Originally built by the West Chester and Philadelphia Railroad, it later served the Pennsylvania Railroad's West Chester Branch, which finally became SEPTA's R3 line. The outer section of the line, including Wawa station, was closed in 1986. Darlington station is a defunct commuter rail station on the SEPTA Regional Rail R3 West Chester Line, located at 612 Darlington Road in Chester Heights, Pennsylvania. Originally built by the West Chester and Philadelphia Railroad, it later served the Pennsylvania Railroad's West Chester Branch, which finally became SEPTA's R3 line. The Philadelphia Belt Line Railroad owns a 2.66 mi long railroad line running along the Delaware River waterfront in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It was created in 1889 to allow any Philadelphia railroad to access the waterfront. The railroad, which does not operate any trains itself, is currently maintained by Conrail Shared Assets Operations and used by CSX Transportation and Norfolk Southern Railway. The West Chester & Philadelphia Railroad (WC&P) operated in the greater Philadelphia area from 1848 to 1881. It became the West Chester Branch of the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR). It has been operated as the Media/Elwyn Line on the SEPTA system since 1983. The Conestoga Creek Viaduct spans the Conestoga River east of Lancaster, Pennsylvania. The present structure, built in 1887-88, is a five-span, two-track stone arch railroad bridge. The first crossing at this location was a 1412 ft series of 11 wooden Town lattice trusses constructed in 1829 for the Columbia and Philadelphia Railroad, which was purchased by the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) and incorporated into its main line in 1857. PRR shortened the viaduct and replaced the remaining wooden trusses with iron Whipple trusses in 1863. The 1887-88 stone arch replacement was originally intended to be four tracks wide, but only half of the superstructure width (two tracks) was constructed, leaving an unfinished spandrel wall on the southern face. Tie rods were added in 1930 to brace the spandrel walls. The Baltimore and Philadelphia Railroad was a railroad line built by the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&O) from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to Baltimore, Maryland. It was built in the 1880s after the B&O lost access to its previous route to Philadelphia, the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad (PW&B). The cost of building the new route, especially the Howard Street Tunnel on the connecting Baltimore Belt Line, led to the B&O's first bankruptcy.

You will be given several paragraphs as context.  \nPlease carefully read all the information and answer the question using reasoning across the paragraphs.  \nProvide the answer directly without adding any explanation.\n\nContext:\nThis article is a list of diseases of sorghum (\"Sorghum bicolor\"). Vigna umbellata (Thunb.) Ohwi and Ohashi, previously \"Phaseolus calcaratus\", is a warm-season annual vine legume with yellow flowers and small edible beans. It is commonly called ricebean or rice bean. To date, it is little known, little researched and little exploited. It is regarded as a minor food and fodder crop and is often grown as intercrop or mixed crop with maize (\"Zea mays\"), sorghum (\"Sorghum bicolor\") or cowpea (\"V. unguiculata\"), as well as a sole crop in the uplands, on a very limited area. Like the other Asiatic \"Vigna\" species, ricebean is a fairly short-lived warm-season annual. Grown mainly as a dried pulse, it is also important as a fodder, a green manure and a vegetable. Ricebean is most widely grown as an intercrop, particularly of maize, throughout Indo-China and extending into southern China, India, Nepal and Bangladesh. In the past it was widely grown as lowland crop on residual soil water after the harvest of long-season rice, but it has been displaced to a great extent where shorter duration rice varieties are grown. Ricebean grows well on a range of soils. It establishes rapidly and has the potential to produce large amounts of nutritious animal fodder and high quality grain. Sorghum bicolor, commonly called sorghum ( ) and also known as great millet, durra, jowari, or milo, is a grass species cultivated for its grain, which is used for food, both for animals and humans, and for ethanol production. Sorghum originated in northern Africa, and is now cultivated widely in tropical and subtropical regions. Sorghum is the world's fifth most important cereal crop after rice, wheat, maize and barley. \"S. bicolor\" is typically an annual, but some cultivars are perennial. It grows in clumps that may reach over 4 m high. The grain is small, ranging from 2 to 4 mm in diameter. Sweet sorghums are sorghum cultivars that are primarily grown for foliage, syrup production, and ethanol; they are taller than those grown for grain. Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) comes from the Latin name \u201cSyrucum (granum)\u201d which means \u201cgrain of Syria\u201d however it originated in eastern Africa. Sorghum is an important species of the grass family, Paceae, and is considered the world\u2019s fifth most important cereal crop. There are many diverse and wild types of Sorghum, however there are seven basic races, the most common in Asia are Durra and Sballu. Sorghum is an important staple crop for more than 500 million people in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, including many people in Nepal. Sorghum is grown on more than 48 ha area around the world. In statistics collected from 1992-1994 about general millet, Nepal had an area of 0.21 million ha, with a yield rate of 1.14 (t/ha), and produced around 0.24 million tons of Sorghum. The entirety of the crop is highly valued, both the grain and the stem are very useful. Sorghum can be cooked in many different ways for food with a high nutritional content, among many other uses. Overall Sorghum is a very important crop worldwide. John David Axtell (February 5, 1934 \u2013 December 2, 2000) was an American geneticist, Lynn Distinguished Professor of Agronomy, member of the National Academy of Sciences. Axtell received the Alexander von Humboldt Award in 1975, the Crop Science Research Award from the Crop Science Society of America in 1976, and the International Award for Distinguished Service to Agriculture in 1984. Axtell was widely noted for his research on sorghum(Sorghum bicolor L.). \"The New York Times\" and other sources reported that Axtell had been one of discoverers of high-lysine sorghum, and that the discovery was crucial to the fight against world hunger. Dhurrin is a cyanogenic glycoside produced in many plants. Discovered in multiple sorghum varieties in 1906 as the culprit of cattle poisoning by hydrogen cyanide, dhurrin is most typically associated with \"Sorghum bicolor\", the organism used for mapping the biosynthesis of dhurrin from tyrosine. Dhurrin's name is derived form the Arabic word for sorghum, transliterated to \"Dhura.\" Sporisorium sorghi is a species of fungus in the Ustilaginaceae family. It is a plant pathogen, causing covered smut of \"sorghum\" spp. such as \"Sorghum bicolor\" (\"S. vulgare\") (sorghum), \"S. sudanense\" (Sudan grass), \"S. halepense\" (Johnson grass) and \"Sorghum\" \"vulgare\" var. \"technichum\" (broomcorn). Sweet sorghum is any of the many varieties of the sorghum grass whose stalks have a high sugar content. Sweet sorghum thrives better under drier and warmer conditions than many other crops and is grown primarily for forage, silage, and syrup production. Although, in most of the United States the term \"molasses\" refers to a sweet syrup, made as a byproduct of sugarcane or sugar beet sugar extraction, sweet sorghum syrup is known as \"sorghum molasses\" in some regions of the U.S Herbaspirillum rubrisubalbicans is a nitrogen-fixing bacterium of the genus \"Herbaspirillum\" found in roots and stems of sugarcane (\"Saccharum officinarum\"), sorghum (\"Sorghum bicolor\"), and rice (\"Oryza sativa\"). \"H. rubrisubalbicans\" can cause symptoms of the mottled stripe disease in sugarcane and sorghum. Leaves inoculated with \"H. rubrisubalbicans\" show red stripes along the secondary veins of the leaf blade. Striga hermonthica, commonly known as purple witchweed or giant witchweed, is a hemiparasitic plant that belongs to the family Orobanchaceae. It is devastating to major crops such as sorghum (\"Sorghum bicolor\") and rice (\"Oryza sativa\"). In sub-Saharan Africa, apart from sorghum and rice, it also infests maize (\"Zea mays\"), pearl millet (\"Pennisetum glaucum\"), and sugar cane (\"Saccharum officinarum\").\n\nQuestion:\nWhat tpe of vegetation does Sorghum bicolor and Sweet sorghum have in common?\n\nPlease give the answer directly without any explanation.", "results": "Both are types of sorghum grass.", "reasoning_chains": []}

You will be given several paragraphs as context.  \nPlease carefully read all the information and answer the question using reasoning across the paragraphs.  \nProvide the answer directly without adding any explanation.\n\nContext:\nRoman roads (Latin: \"viae\"; singular: \"via\" meaning way) were physical infrastructure vital to the maintenance and development of the Roman state, and were built from about 300 BC through the expansion and consolidation of the Roman Republic and the Roman Empire. They provided efficient means for the overland movement of armies, officials, and civilians, and the inland carriage of official communications and trade goods. Roman roads were of several kinds, ranging from small local roads to broad, long-distance highways built to connect cities, major towns and military bases. These major roads were often stone-paved and metaled, cambered for drainage, and were flanked by footpaths, bridleways and drainage ditches. They were laid along accurately surveyed courses, and some were cut through hills, or conducted over rivers and ravines on bridgework. Sections could be supported over marshy ground on rafted or piled foundations. Nicolas Bergier (] ), Avocat au Si\u00e8ge Pr\u00e9sidial de Rheims, lived in 17th-century Rheims and became interested in Roman roads there. Mentioning by chance his interest in the funding of Roman roads to Conde du Lis, advisor to Louis XIII, he found himself suddenly commanded by the king to undertake a study of all Roman roads. Five years later he published his \"Histoire des Grands Chemins de l'Empire Romain\", a two-volume work of over 1000 pages. There were many subsequent editions. This first scholarly study of Roman roads included engravings of the Tabula Peutingeriana. Edward Gibbon consulted Bergier's work while researching his \"Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire\". Roman bridge, located in the village of Catribana (S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o das Lampas, Sintra), crossing over the Samarra river. The bridge is composed of a single arch and parapet, with several restorations and changes over the centuries. Probably it was part of a secondary Roman road that connected the several villa of the Olisipo region. Remains of a Roman road, necropolis and some mosaics and ceramic fragments were also found nearby. The technology history of the Roman military covers the development of and application of technologies for use in the armies and navies of Rome from the Roman Republic to the fall of the Western Roman Empire. The rise of Hellenism and the Roman Republic are generally seen as signalling the end of the Iron Age in the Mediterranean. Roman iron-working was enhanced by a process known as carburization. The Romans used the better properties in their armaments, and the 1,300 years of Roman military technology saw radical changes. The Roman armies of the early empire were much better equipped than early republican armies. Metals used for arms and armor primarily included iron, bronze, and brass. For construction, the army used wood, earth, and stone. The later use of concrete in architecture was widely mirrored in Roman military technology, especially in the application of a military workforce to civilian construction projects. Margary numbers constitute the numbering scheme developed by the historian Ivan Margary to catalogue known and suspected Roman roads in Britain in his 1955 work \"The Roman Roads of Britain\". They remain the standard means used by archaeologists and historians to identify individual Roman roads within Britain. It is not known how the Romans identified the roads they built within Britain, and well-known names such as Watling Street and the Fosse Way largely date from the Anglo-Saxon period, are sometimes ambiguous or duplicated, and cover only a small proportion of the known network. The history of the Constitution of the Roman Republic is a study of the ancient Roman Republic that traces the progression of Roman political development from the founding of the Roman Republic in 509 BC until the founding of the Roman Empire in 27 BC. The constitutional history of the Roman Republic can be divided into five phases. The first phase began with the revolution which overthrew the Roman Kingdom in 510 BC, and the final phase ended with the revolution which overthrew the Roman Republic, and thus created the Roman Empire, in 27 BC. Throughout the history of the republic, the constitutional evolution was driven by the struggle between the aristocracy and the ordinary citizens. The first name of P\u00e9rignat was \"Patrinoacum.\" An early hamlet evolved around the villa of a certain Patrinius, an important landholder. Under the Romans a villa was the center of an estate dedicated to agricultural production, often extending hundreds of hectares. At P\u00e9rignat there are still found remains of a Roman road and a necropolis with a sarcophagus and ceramic dated to the second century. Roman roads in Britain are long roads, mainly designed for military use, created by the Roman Army during the nearly four centuries (43 \u2013 410 AD) that Britain was a province of the Roman Empire. It is estimated that the Romans constructed and maintained about 2000 mi of paved trunk roads (i.e. surfaced roads running between two towns or cities) throughout the province, although most of the known network was complete by AD 180. The primary function of the network was to allow rapid movement of troops and military supplies, but it also provided vital infrastructure for commerce, trade and the transportation of goods. The history of the Roman Empire covers the history of Ancient Rome from the fall of the Roman Republic in 27 BC until the abdication of the last Western emperor in 476 AD. Rome had begun expanding shortly after the founding of the Republic in the 6th century BC, though it did not expand outside of the Italian Peninsula until the 3rd century BC. Civil war engulfed the Roman state in the mid 1st century BC, first between Julius Caesar and Pompey, and finally between Octavian and Mark Antony. Antony was defeated at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC. In 27 BC the Senate and People of Rome made Octavian \"imperator\" (\"commander\") thus beginning the Principate, the first epoch of Roman imperial history usually dated from 27 BC to 284 AD; they later awarded him the name Augustus, \"the venerated\". The success of Augustus in establishing principles of dynastic succession was limited by his outliving a number of talented potential heirs: the Julio-Claudian dynasty lasted for four more emperors\u2014Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius, and Nero\u2014before it yielded in 69 AD to the strife-torn Year of Four Emperors, from which Vespasian emerged as victor. Vespasian became the founder of the brief Flavian dynasty, to be followed by the Nerva\u2013Antonine dynasty which produced the \"Five Good Emperors\": Nerva, Trajan, Hadrian, Antoninus Pius and the philosophically inclined Marcus Aurelius. In the view of the Greek historian Dio Cassius, a contemporary observer, the accession of the emperor Commodus in 180 AD marked the descent \"from a kingdom of gold to one of rust and iron\"\u2014a famous comment which has led some historians, notably Edward Gibbon, to take Commodus' reign as the beginning of the decline of the Roman Empire. This history of the Byzantine Empire covers the history of the Eastern Roman Empire from late antiquity until the Fall of Constantinople in 1453 AD. Several events from the 4th to 6th centuries mark the transitional period during which the Roman Empire's east and west divided. In 285, the emperor Diocletian (r. 284\u2013305) partitioned the Roman Empire's administration into eastern and western halves. Between 324 and 330, Constantine I (r. 306\u2013337) transferred the main capital from Rome to Byzantium, later known as \"Constantinople\" (\"City of Constantine\") and \"Nova Roma\" (\"New Rome\"). Under Theodosius I (r. 379\u2013395), Christianity became the Empire's official state religion and others such as Roman polytheism were proscribed. And finally, under the reign of Heraclius (r. 610\u2013641), the Empire's military and administration were restructured and adopted Greek for official use instead of Latin. Thus, although it continued the Roman state and maintained Roman state traditions, modern historians distinguish Byzantium from ancient Rome insofar as it was oriented towards Greek rather than Latin culture, and characterised by Orthodox Christianity rather than Roman polytheism.\n\nQuestion:\nAt P\u00e9rignat there are still found remains of a Roman road and a necropolis with a sarcophagus and ceramic dated to the second century, Roman roads were physical infrastructure vital to the maintenance and development of the Roman state, and were built from about which year, through the expansion and consolidation of the Roman Republic and the Roman Empire?\n\nPlease give the answer directly without any explanation.", "results": "300 BC", "reasoning_chains": []}

California, 573 U.S. __ (2014) is a landmark United States Supreme Court case in which the Court unanimously held that the warrantless search and seizure of digital contents of a cell phone during an arrest is unconstitutional. Kennedy v. Louisiana, 554 U.S. 407 (2008) , is a landmark decision by the Supreme Court of the United States that held that the Eighth Amendment's Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause prohibits imposing the death penalty for the rape of a child in cases where the victim did not die and death was not intended. The Louisiana State Treasurer special election will take place on October 14, 2017, to elect the State Treasurer of Louisiana, with a runoff election to be held on November 18, 2017, if necessary. Incumbent Republican State Treasurer John Kennedy was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2016. First Assistant Treasurer Ron Henson replaced Kennedy as Treasurer, and will serve until the special election. Henson will not run in the special election. In U.S. law, the bad tendency principle is a test which permits restriction of freedom of speech by government if it is believed that a form of speech has a sole tendency to incite or cause illegal activity. The principle, formulated in \"Patterson v. Colorado\", (1907) was seemingly overturned with the \"clear and present danger\" principle used in the landmark case \"Schenck v. United States\" (1919), as stated by Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. Yet eight months later, at the start of the next Term in \"Abrams v. United States\" (1919) the Court again used the bad tendency test to uphold the conviction of a Russian immigrant who published and distributed leaflets calling for a general strike and otherwise advocated revolutionary, anarchist, and socialist views. Holmes dissented in \"Abrams\", explaining how the \"clear and present danger test\" should be employed to overturn Abrams' conviction. The arrival of the \"bad tendency\" test resulted in a string of politically incorrect rulings such as Whitney v. California (1927), where a woman was convicted simply because of her association with the Communist Party. The court ruled unanimously that although she had not committed any crimes, her relationship with the Communists represented a \"bad tendency\" and thus was unprotected. The \"bad tendency\" test was finally overturned in Brandenburg v. Ohio (1969) and was replaced by the \"imminent lawless action\" test. People v. Diaz 51 Cal. 4th 84, 244 P.3d 501, 119 Cal. Rptr. 3d 105 (Cal. January 3, 2011) was a Supreme Court of California case holding that police are not required to obtain a warrant to search information contained within a cell phone in a lawful arrest. In a sting operation conducted by local police, the defendant, Gregory Diaz, was arrested for the sale of the illicit drug ecstasy and his cell phone, containing incriminating evidence, was seized and searched without a warrant. In trial court proceedings, Diaz motioned to suppress the information obtained from his cell phone, which was denied on the grounds that the search of his cell phone was incident to a lawful arrest. The California Court of Appeal affirmed the court's decision, a ruling which was later upheld by the California Supreme Court. In 2014, the United States Supreme Court overruled that position in \"Riley v. California\", holding that without a warrant, police may not search the digital information on a cell phone that has been seized incident to arrest. Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, 372 U.S. 144 (1963) , was a Supreme Court of the United States case in which the Court amended United States nationality law with respect to draft evasion. The U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in \"Obergefell v. Hodges\" on June 26, 2015, held that the denial of marriage rights to same-sex couples is unconstitutional, invalidating the ban on same-sex marriage in Louisiana. The ruling clarified conflicting court rulings on whether Louisianian officials are obligated to license same-sex marriages. Governor Bobby Jindal confirmed on June 28 that Louisiana would comply with the ruling once the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed its decision in a Louisiana case, which the Fifth Circuit did on July 1. Jindal then said the state would not comply with the ruling until the federal District Court reversed its judgment, which it did on July 2. All parishes now issue marriage licenses in accordance with federal law.

The event concluded with a major storyline development, where Chikara's authority figure Wink Vavasseur ended the event and shut down the promotion, while the main event was still going on in the ring, leading to the promotion going inactive for a full year. \"The Constitution is not a suicide pact\" is a phrase in American political and legal discourse. The phrase expresses the belief that constitutional restrictions on governmental power must be balanced against the need for survival of the state and its people. It is most often attributed to Abraham Lincoln, as a response to charges that he was violating the United States Constitution by suspending \"habeas corpus\" during the American Civil War. Although the phrase echoes statements made by Lincoln, and although versions of the sentiment have been advanced at various times in American history, the precise phrase \"suicide pact\" was first used in this context by Justice Robert H. Jackson in his dissenting opinion in \"Terminiello v. Chicago\", a 1949 free speech case decided by the U.S. Supreme Court. The phrase also appears in the same context in \"Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez\", a 1963 U.S. Supreme Court decision written by Justice Arthur Goldberg. Coker v. Georgia, 433 U.S. 584 (1977) , held that the death penalty for rape of an adult woman was grossly disproportionate and excessive punishment, and therefore unconstitutional under the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution. A few states continued to have child rape statutes that authorized the death penalty. In \"Kennedy v. Louisiana\" (2008), the court expanded \"Coker\", ruling that the death penalty is unconstitutional in all cases that do not involve murder or crimes against the State.\n\nQuestion:\nDid the Kennedy v.

This is often the case when a product is announced too long before its actual availability. This has the immediate effect of customers canceling or deferring orders for the current product, knowing that it will soon be obsolete, and any unexpected delays often means the new product comes to be perceived as vaporware, damaging the company's credibility and profitability. Steven George Mandis (born in 1970) is an American investor and the founder of Kalamata Capital. He is also adjunct associate professor in finance and economics at Columbia University Business School, having previously worked at Goldman Sachs and Citigroup and as a senior advisor to McKinsey. He is the author of \"What Happened to Goldman Sachs: An Insider's Story of Organizational Drift and its Unintended Consequences\" and \"The Real Madrid Way: How Values Created the Most Successful Sports Team on the Planet.\" Blowback is a term originating from within the American Intelligence community, denoting the unintended consequences, unwanted side-effects, or suffered repercussions of a covert operation that fall back on those responsible for the aforementioned operations. Christopher Ategeka (born July 10, 1984) is a serial entrepreneur and an engineer in Silicon Valley. He pioneered the unintended consequences of technology (UCOT) movement. Chris coined and popularized the term \"UCOT\" in the tech sector and the concept of \"UCOT\" evangelism. He is the founder at LyfBase a solutions company for the negative unintended consequences of technology. Before that, he founded Health Access Corps and co-founder of Privail. In the social sciences, unintended consequences (sometimes unanticipated consequences or unforeseen consequences) are outcomes that are not the ones foreseen and intended by a purposeful action. The term was popularised in the twentieth century by American sociologist Robert K. Merton. Operation Cat Drop is the name commonly given to an account, of uncertain veracity, about the delivery, by the United Kingdom's Royal Air Force, of cats to a remote village in Sarawak, Borneo. The cats were delivered in crates, dropped by parachute, as part of a broader program of supplying cats to combat a plague of rats. The cat population had previously been reduced as an unintended consequence of spraying DDT for malaria control. The story, often with various elaborations is often told as an illustration of the problems that may arise from well-intended interventions in the environment, or of unintended consequences more generally. Robert King Merton (born Meyer Robert Schkolnick; 4 July 1910 \u2013 23 February 2003) was an American sociologist. He spent most of his career teaching at Columbia University, where he attained the rank of University Professor. In 1994 he was awarded the National Medal of Science for his contributions to the field and for having founded the sociology of science. He is considered a founding father of modern sociology. Stephanos Bibas (born 1969) is a professor of law and criminology at the University of Pennsylvania Law School; he is a leading scholar of criminal procedure with expertise in criminal charging, plea bargaining and sentencing. He has been announced as a nominee to be a United States Circuit Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. A former federal prosecutor, Bibas examines how procedural rules written for jury trials have unintended consequences when cases involving jury trials are the exception, rather than the rule, with 95 percent of defendants pleading guilty. Bibas also studies the role of substantive goals such as remorse and apology in criminal procedure. A slippery slope argument (SSA), in logic, critical thinking, political rhetoric, and caselaw, is a consequentialist logical device in which a party asserts that a relatively small first step leads to a chain of related events culminating in some significant (usually negative) effect. The core of the slippery slope argument is that a specific decision under debate is likely to result in unintended consequences. The strength of such an argument depends on the warrant, i.e. whether or not one can demonstrate a process that leads to the significant effect. This type of argument is sometimes used as a form of fear mongering, in which the probable consequences of a given action are exaggerated in an attempt to scare the audience. The fallacious sense of \"slippery slope\" is often used synonymously with continuum fallacy, in that it ignores the possibility of middle ground and assumes a discrete transition from category A to category B. In a non-fallacious sense, including use as a legal principle, a middle-ground possibility is acknowledged, and reasoning is provided for the likelihood of the predicted outcome. Therapeutic jurisprudence (\"TJ\") studies law as a social force (or agent) which inevitably gives rise to unintended consequences, which may be either beneficial (therapeutic) or harmful (anti-therapeutic). These consequences flow from the operation of legal rules or legal procedures - or from the behavior of legal actors (such as lawyers and judges). TJ researchers and practitioners typically make use of social science methods and data to study the extent to which a legal rule or practice affects the psychological well-being of the people it affects, and then explore ways in which anti-therapeutic consequences can be reduced, and therapeutic consequences enhanced, without breaching due process requirements.\n\nQuestion:\nAt which University did the sociologist who popularised the term \"Unintended consequences\" spend most of his career and attain the rank of University Professor?\n\nPlease give the answer directly without any explanation.", "results": "Columbia University", "reasoning_chains": []}

Jacques d'Amboise (between 1440 and 1450 \u2013 27 December 1516) was a French religious dignitary and patron of medieval France. He was abbot of Jumi\u00e8ges then of Cluny, and bishop of Clermont. He was a member of the House of Amboise, an old noble family. Jacques de Clermont d'Amboise (c.15251587) was the third son of Louis de Clermont, Lord of Gallerande, butler of the king, and Ren\u00e9e d'Amboise.

{"question": "You are an expert in multi-hop question answering. You will be given several paragraphs as context.  \nPlease carefully read all the information and answer the question using reasoning across the paragraphs.  \nProvide the answer directly without adding any explanation.\n\nContext:\nSwedish neutrality refers to Sweden's former policy of neutrality in armed conflicts, which was in effect from the early 19th century, until 2009, when Sweden entered into various mutual defence treaties with the EU, and other Nordic countries. In 2016 Sweden became a \"NATO Affiliate\" (not member), and signed a treaty allowing NATO operations to take place within the country's borders. Sweden's previous neutrality policy had originated largely as a result of Sweden's involvement in the Napoleonic Wars during which over a third of the country's territory was lost, including the traumatic loss of Finland to Russia. Resentment towards the old king precipitated a \"coup d'\u00e9tat\" and the new regime formulated a new foreign policy which became known as \"The Policy of 1812\". Since the time of the Napoleonic Wars, Sweden has not initiated any direct armed combat. However, Sweden's military and government have been involved in major peacekeeping actions and other military support functions around the world. The accession to the European Union in 1995 meant that neutrality as a principle was abolished. Sweden is still today a neutral and non-aligned country in regard to foreign and security policy. However, it maintains strong links to NATO. The Neum Agreement is an unimplemented treaty between Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina granting free passage of transit traffic between the territory of Dubrovnik-Neretva County around the city of Dubrovnik and forming a pene-exclave of Croatia and the reaining Croatian territory through the municipality of Neum. 2013 Nordic storms were a series of storms affecting predominantly the Nordic nations with other northern European nations also affected. The first storm in the series Hilde, named Otto by Free University of Berlin, and Eino in Finland was an extratropical cyclone affecting parts of northern Europe, causing disruption to electricity supplies and transportation across mid Norway, northern Sweden and central Finland in 15. \u2013 18. November 2013. The storm brought a new record average wind speed to Sweden (at altitude), however wind speeds at lower altitudes were less than seen during the Dagmar storm of 2011. Most damage was caused by falling trees along the storms path likely exacerbated by unfrozen ground. The total cost of damage is likely to be low, as the storm passed over relatively unpopulated regions of the Nordic nations. InfoGear Technology Corporation, founded in 1995, was an American technology and services company which developed and marketed an early type of desktop phone which it named iPhone. The company and its trademark of the iPhone name were acquired in 2000 by Cisco Systems. In 2007, Apple Inc. and Cisco reached an agreement allowing Apple to use the iPhone name on its own distinct iPhone products. Clinton Rickard (1882-1971) was a Tuscarora chief known for founding the Indian Defense League, and for promoting Native American sovereignty. He worked for free passage of Native Americans across the US-Canada border, and to prevent the flooding of the Tuscarora Reservation. An open border is a border that enables free movement of people between different jurisdictions with limited or no restrictions on movement, that is to say lacking substantive border control. A border may be an open border due to a lack of legal controls or intentional legislation allowing free movement of people across the border (\"de jure\"), or a border may be an open border due to lack of adequate enforcement or adequate supervision of the border (\"de facto\"). An example of the former is the Schengen Agreement between most members of the European Economic Area (EFTA and the EU). An example of the latter has been the border between Bangladesh and India, which is becoming controlled. The term \"open borders\" applies only to the flow of people, not the flow of goods and services, and only to borders between political jurisdictions, not to mere boundaries of privately owned property. The Nordic Passport Union allows citizens of the Nordic countriesIceland, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and Finlandto travel and reside in another Nordic country (excluding Greenland and Svalbard) without any travel documentation (e.g. a passport or national identity card) or a residence permit. Since 25 March 2001, all five states have also been within the Schengen Area. The Faroe Islands are part of the Nordic Passport Union but not the Schengen Area, while Greenland and Svalbard are outside both. The Finnish-Swedish border is the border between the countries of Finland and Sweden. Almost the entire border runs through water: along the Tornio River and its tributaries, and in the Gulf of Bothnia. Only a few kilometres of the border are on dry land. Because of the Schengen treaty and the Nordic Passport Union, the border can be crossed mostly freely. UNITED for Intercultural Action is a European network against nationalism, racism, fascism and in support of migrants and refugees, in which over 560 organisations from 48 European countries cooperate.

NJPW currently controls two junior heavyweight championships: the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship and the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship. The weight-limit for the tag team title is 100 kg ; it is assumed that this title has the same weight-limit. From August\u00a05, 1996, until November\u00a05, 1997, the title was part of the J-Crown, or J-Crown Octuple Unified Championship.

On November\u00a05, 1997, then-champion Shinjiro Otani vacated all J-Crown belts but the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship after the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) retook control of its Light Heavyweight title, effectively ending the J-Crown.

Tugou includes the most popular Chinese dog breed - the Chinese Field Dog (, pinyin: \"zh\u014dng hu\u00e1 ti\u00e1n yu\u00e1n qu\u01cen\"), Chinese Chongqing Dog, Xiasi Dog, and several other native dog breeds distributed across China. They are roughly 45\u201350\u00a0cm tall at the shoulder. Robert Kaleski was a self-taught writer, bushman, environmentalist and canine authority living in New South Wales at the turn of the nineteenth century. While he is perhaps best known for his role in breeding the Australian Cattle Dog he also developed the first breed standard for the Australian Kelpie, wrote on a number of practical subjects for the newspapers of the time, and published works of fiction in magazines such as The Bulletin. In addition Kaleski patented his designs for improved farm implements, and developed and applied successful theories of soil management in times of drought. A sheep dog or sheepdog is generally a dog or breed of dogs historically used in connection with the raising of sheep. These may include livestock guardian or pastoral dogs used to guard sheep and other livestock in farms for farmers, and herding dogs used to herd sheep and other livestock. Bond sheep are an Australian sheep breed that was developed around 1909 near Lockhart, New South Wales by Thomas Bond when he mated Saxon-Peppin Merino ewes to stud Lincoln rams for primarily wool production. The resulting progeny was selected on the basis that they would be more suited to the Riverina environment. Initially these sheep were known as \u2018the Commercial Corriedale\u2019. Koko (9 April 2005 \u00a0\u2013 18 December 2012) was an Australian canine film actor and fundraiser, an Australian Kelpie who best known for his role as Red Dog the title character of the 2011 film \"Red Dog\". He was owned by Nelson Woss, a producer of \"Red Dog\". The Chinese Chongqing Dog is a rare breed of dog native to the Chongqing city of China. In its early years, it was used for hunting wild boar and rabbits, but it's now used in China to protect families and belongings. They are an ancient, natural breed said to have existed for 2,000 years since the time of the Han Dynasty in Ancient China. After the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949, the breed's numbers were greatly reduced, and only people in rural communities still kept it; the breed is still rare, even in China. A sheep dog is a dog or breed of dog traditionally used in the herding of sheep. The Wide Comb dispute was a landmark Australian industrial dispute. Australian sheep shearers, represented by the Australian Workers' Union, opposed the alteration of the Federal Pastoral Industry Award to allow the use of shearing equipment that used combs wider than 2.5\u00a0inches. Business and farming groups, such as the National Farmers Federation, supported the alteration of the award as they believed that the wider combs increased productivity. The dispute culminated in a 10-week national strike by shearers in 1983. The dispute was resolved by the decision of the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission to allow the use of the wide comb shears. The defeat of the AWU in the wide comb dispute has been widely cited as the cause of a decline in union membership and militancy amongst Australian shearers. The Australian Kelpie, or simply Kelpie, is an Australian sheep dog successful at mustering and droving with little or no guidance. It is a medium-sized dog and comes in a variety of colours. The Kelpie has been exported throughout the world and is used to muster livestock, primarily sheep, cattle and goats. A muster (Au/NZ) or a roundup (US) is the process of gathering livestock. Musters usually involve cattle, sheep or horses, but may also include goats, camels, buffalo or other animals. Mustering may be conducted for a variety of reasons including routine livestock health checks and treatments, branding, shearing, lamb marking, sale, feeding and transport or droving to another location. Mustering is a long, difficult and sometimes dangerous job, especially on the vast Australian cattle stations of the Top End, 'The Falls' (gorge) country of the Great Dividing Range and the ranches of the western United States. The group of animals gathered in a muster is referred to as a \"mob\" in Australia and a \"herd\" in North America.\n\nQuestion:\nAustralian Kelpie is an Australian sheep dog successful at mustering and droving with little or no guidance.

Appleton and Company as a book in New York and in London. It won the 1921 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, making Wharton the first woman to win the prize. Though the committee initially agreed to award the prize to Sinclair Lewis, the judges rejected his \"Main Street\" on political grounds and \"established Wharton as the American 'First Lady of Letters'\", the irony being that the committee had awarded \"The Age of Innocence\" the prize on grounds that negated Wharton's own blatant and subtle ironies, which constitute and make the book so worthy of attention. The story is set in upper-class New York City in the 1870s, during the Gilded Age. Wharton wrote the book in her 50s, after she had established herself as a strong author with publishers clamoring for her work. The Decoration of Houses, a manual of interior design written by Edith Wharton with architect Ogden Codman, was first published in 1897. In the book, the authors denounce Victorian-style interior decoration and interior design, especially rooms decorated with heavy window curtains, Victorian bric-a-brac and overstuffed furniture. They argue that such rooms emphasize upholstery at the expense of proper space planning and architectural design and are, therefore, uncomfortable and rarely used. Wharton and Codman advocated the creation of houses with rooms decorated with strong architectural wall and ceiling treatments, accentuated by well-suited furniture, rooms based on simple, classical design principles such as symmetry and proportion and a sense of architectural balance. \"The Decoration of Houses\" is considered a seminal work and its success led to the emergence of professional decorators working in the manner advocated by its authors, most notably Elsie de Wolfe. The book was reprinted by The Mount and Rizzoli and in a hardcover facsimile in 2007. The Reef is a 1912 novel by American writer Edith Wharton. It was published by D. Appleton & Company. It concerns a romance between a widow and her former lover. The novel takes place in Paris and rural France, but primarily features American characters. While writing the novel, Edith Wharton visited England, Sicily, and Germany, among other locations. In a letter to Bernard Berenson in November 1912, Wharton expressed regret regarding her novel, calling it a \u201cpoor miserable lifeless lump\u201d. She wrote, \u201cAnyhow, remember it\u2019s not me, though I thought it was when I was writing it\u2014& that next time I\u2019m going to do something worthwhile!!\u201d Summer is a novel by Edith Wharton published in 1917 by Charles Scribner's Sons. The story is one of only two novels to be set in New England by Wharton, who was best known for her portrayals of upper-class New York society. The novel details the sexual awakening of its protagonist, Charity Royall, and her cruel treatment by the father of her child, and shares many plot similarities with Wharton's better-known novel, \"Ethan Frome\". Only moderately well received when originally published, \"Summer\" has had a resurgence in critical popularity since the 1960s. Gentlemen Prefer Blondes: The Intimate Diary of a Professional Lady is a comic novel written by Anita Loos, first published in 1925. It is one of several famous novels published that year to chronicle the so-called Jazz Age, including Fitzgerald's \"The Great Gatsby\" and Van Vechten's \"Firecrackers\". Loos was inspired to write the book after watching a sexy blonde turn intellectual H. L. Mencken into a lovestruck schoolboy. Mencken, a close friend, actually enjoyed the work and saw to it that it was published. Originally published as a magazine series in \"Harper's Bazaar\", it was published as a book by Boni & Liveright in 1925 and became a runaway best seller, becoming the second best selling title of 1926 and earning the praise of no less than Edith Wharton who dubbed it \"The Great American Novel.\" The Buccaneers is the last novel written by Edith Wharton. It was unfinished at the time of her death in 1937, and published in that form in 1938. Wharton's manuscript ends with Lizzy's inviting Nan to a house party to which Guy Thwarte has also been invited. The House of Mirth (1905), a novel by Edith Wharton (1862\u20131937), tells the story of Lily Bart, a well-born but impoverished woman belonging to New York City\u2019s high society around the turn of the last century. Wharton creates a portrait of a stunning beauty who, though raised and educated to marry well both socially and economically, is reaching her 29th year, an age when her youthful blush is drawing to a close and her marital prospects are becoming ever more limited. \"The House of Mirth\" traces Lily\u2019s slow two-year social descent from privilege to a tragically lonely existence on the margins of society. In the words of one scholar, Wharton uses Lily as an attack on \"an irresponsible, grasping and morally corrupt upper class.\" Robert von Ranke Graves (24 July 1895 \u2013 7 December 1985), also known as Robert Ranke Graves and most commonly Robert Graves, was an English poet, novelist, critic and classicist. In a way similar to Oscar Wilde, Robert Graves was a Celticist and student of Irish mythology, by the influence of his father Alfred Perceval Graves, a celebrated Irish poet \u2014 with William Wilde, these families were inheritors of the Gaelic revival. He produced more than 140 works. Graves's poems\u2014together with his translations and innovative analysis and interpretations of the Greek myths; his memoir of his early life, including his role in the First World War, \"Good-Bye to All That\"; and his speculative study of poetic inspiration, \"The White Goddess\"\u2014have never been out of print. Irish literature deeply affected Graves' White Goddess theories, specifically the genre aisling. \"Afterward\" is a short story by American writer Edith Wharton. It was first published in the 1910 edition of \"The Century Magazine\". and later reprinted in her books \" The Collected Short Stories of Edith Wharton\" and \"Tales of Men and Ghosts\" (1910). It is an ironic ghost story about greed and retribution. The ghost comes for one of the main characters long after a business transgression where the character wronged another. Edith Wharton ( ; born Edith Newbold Jones; January 24, 1862 \u2013 August 11, 1937) was an American novelist, short story writer, and designer. Wharton combined an insider's view of American aristocracy with a powerful prose style. Her novels and short stories realistically portrayed the lives and morals of the late nineteenth century, an era of decline and faded wealth. She won the Pulitzer Prize for Literature in 1921, and was the first woman to receive this honor. Wharton was acquainted with many of the well-known people of her day, both in America and in Europe, including President Theodore Roosevelt.\n\nQuestion:\nDid Robert Graves and Edith Wharton both write novels?\n\nPlease give the answer directly without any explanation.", "results": "Yes, both Robert Graves and Edith Wharton wrote novels.", "reasoning_chains": []}

It was written by Howard Simon and first performed in 1999. Originally directed by Chuck Patterson, the first run starred Charles Reese as James Baldwin and Forrest McClendon as his counterpart, an ethereal force which takes multiple identities. Between the World and Me is a 2015 book written by Ta-Nehisi Coates and published by Spiegel & Grau. It is written as a letter to the author's teenaged son about the feelings, symbolism, and realities associated with being black in the United States. Coates recapitulates American history and explains to his son the \"racist violence that has been woven into American culture.\" Coates draws from an abridged, autobiographical account of his youth in Baltimore, detailing the ways in which institutions like the school, the police, and even \"the streets\" discipline, endanger, and threaten to disembody black men and women. The work takes inspiration from James Baldwin's 1963 \"The Fire Next Time\". Unlike Baldwin, Coates sees white supremacy as an indestructible force, one that black Americans will never evade or erase, but will always struggle against. Jesmyn Ward is an American novelist and an associate professor of English at Tulane University. She won the 2011 National Book Award for Fiction and a 2012 Alex Award with her second novel \"Salvage the Bones\", a story about familial love and community covering the 10 days preceding Hurricane Katrina, the day of the cyclone, and the day after.

The Fire This Time: A New Generation Speaks About Race is a 2016 essay and poetry collection edited by Jesmyn Ward, the title alluding to James Baldwin's seminal 1963 text \"The Fire Next Time\". Whiteness studies is an interdisciplinary arena of inquiry that has developed beginning in the United States, particularly since the late 20th century, and is focused on what proponents describe as the cultural, historical and sociological aspects of people identified as white, and the social construction of \"whiteness\" as an ideology tied to social status. Pioneers in the field include W. E. B. Du Bois (\"Jefferson Davis as a Representative of Civilization\", 1890; \"Darkwater\", 1920), James Baldwin (\"The Fire Next Time\", 1963), Theodore W. Allen (\"The Invention of the White Race,\" 1976, expanded in 1995), Ruth Frankenberg (\"White Women, Race Matters: The Social Construction of Whiteness\", 1993), author and literary critic Toni Morrison (\"Playing in the Dark: Whiteness and the Literary Imagination\", 1992) and historian David Roediger (\"The Wages of Whiteness\", 1991). By the mid-1990s, numerous works across many disciplines analyzed whiteness, and it has since become a topic for academic courses, research and anthologies. Mary Quade (born October 21, 1971) is an American writer of poetry and nonfiction. In 2003, her poetry collection \"Guide to Native Beasts\" won the Cleveland State University Poetry Center First Book Prize, chosen by judge Marilyn Krysl. Her second collection, \"Local Extinctions\", was published in 2016 by Gold Wake Press. She earned her A.B. from the University of Chicago and her M.F.A. from The University of Iowa Writers\u2019 Workshop. Her work has been awarded an Oregon Literary Fellowship (2001) and three Ohio Arts Council Individual Excellence Awards (Poetry 2006, Poetry 2010, Prose 2014). She is an Associate Professor of English at Hiram College where she teaches creative writing. James Arthur \"Jimmy\" Baldwin (August 2, 1924 \u2013 December 1, 1987) was an American writer and social critic. His essays, as collected in \"Notes of a Native Son\" (1955), explore palpable yet unspoken intricacies of racial, sexual, and class distinctions in Western societies, most notably in mid-20th-century America. Some of Baldwin's essays are book-length, for instance \"The Fire Next Time\" (1963), \"No Name in the Street\" (1972), and \"The Devil Finds Work\" (1976). An unfinished manuscript, \"Remember This House\", was expanded upon and adapted for cinema as the Academy Award-nominated documentary film \"I Am Not Your Negro\". Tales of Heich\u016b (Heich\u016b monogatari) belongs to the genre of uta monogatari poem tales that emerged in Japanese literature from the mid 10th to the early 11th centuries. As early as the \"Collection of Ten-Thousand Leaves\" (\"Many\u014dsh\u016b\"), a poetry collection completed around 759, there appeared poems introduced by brief prose narrations. The imperial court began to come alive with poetry from around this time. People exchanged poetry with one another on topics as diverse as love and politics and religion. Towards the end of the 9th century it was common for individual poets to keep compilations of their own verse, sometimes explaining in prose the circumstances behind a poem's composition. The highest honor was to have ones poem selected for inclusion in the \"Collection of Ancient and Modern Poetry\" (Kokinsh\u016b), the first imperial poetry collection, which was completed around 905. By the middle of the 10th century the idea of a poem paired with a prose narration seems to have taken hold, and \"Tales of Ise\" (Ise monogatari), \"Tales of Heich\u016b\", and \"Tales of Yamato\" (Yamato monogatari) seem to have emerged at about this same time. Also, the second imperial poetry collection, \"Collection of Later Poetry\" (Gosensh\u016b), commissioned in 951 and compiled shortly thereafter, has many narrative qualities. The only extant manuscript of \"Tales of Heich\u016b\" is a 61-page codex discovered in 1931 that seems to date from the Kamakura Period (1185\u20131333), some three hundred years after the work's probable date of composition. The Fire Next Time is a 1963 book by James Baldwin. It contains two essays: \"My Dungeon Shook \u2014 Letter to my Nephew on the One Hundredth Anniversary of Emancipation,\" and \"Down At The Cross \u2014 Letter from a Region of My Mind.\" The first essay, written in the form of a letter to Baldwin's 14-year-old nephew, discusses the central role of race in American history. The second essay deals with the relations between race and religion, focusing in particular on Baldwin's experiences with the Christian church as a youth, as well as the Islamic ideas of others in Harlem.

She was the most popular singing star of the Indian sub-continent of her generation. Until 1943, as a child singer, Suraiya did playback singing for one actress, namely Mehtab, in three films, and also in some of her own films for her roles as a child artiste. After this, she only sang for her own films as an actress, and acted as a heroine from 1946 until the end of her career in 1963.

His work on \"Swan Lake\" was considered unsuccessful by the critics of the day but not necessarily unsuccessful by the theatre-going public\u2014after all, Reisinger's original production of \"Swan Lake\" was kept in the active repertoire of the Bolshoi Theatre for seven years and was performed over thirty times during a period when other ballets could not sustain even twenty performances. In fact, the production was not pulled until the scenery and costumes were worn and threadbare. Much of its popularity was assumably due to its beautiful musical score which was critically acclaimed even though the choreography was not.

Overall, it was the fourth work stoppage since 1972, but actions in 1973, 1976, and 1980 did not result in any regular season games being cancelled. The strike began on June 12 and forced the cancellation of 713 games (or 38 percent of the Major League schedule) in the middle of the regular season. The two sides reached an agreement on July 31, and play resumed on August 9 with the All-Star Game, with regular season play resuming one day later. Personal Foul: A First-Person Account of the Scandal That Rocked the NBA is an autobiography written by former National Basketball Association (NBA) referee Tim Donaghy and published by Florida-based VTi-Group, Inc. in December, 2009. Donaghy, who had resigned from the league as a central figure in the 2007 NBA betting scandal, describes his involvement in and inner workings of the scandal, as well as his gambling addiction. The following is a list of games that have been canceled by the National Football League since 1933. While canceling games was extremely common prior to this date, since that year, the NFL has only twice canceled regular season games, in both cases due to labor disputes between the league and the National Football League Players Association. Seven weeks of regular season games were canceled in 1982 and one week of regular season games was canceled in 1987. Gary Allan \"Gubbio\" Gambucci (born September 22, 1946 in Hibbing, Minnesota) is a retired American ice hockey forward who appeared in a total of 51 National Hockey League regular season games with the Minnesota North Stars in 1971\u201374. Before turning professional, Gambucci excelled as a scorer for the United States national team at the 1969, 1970 and 1971 Ice Hockey World Championships as well as the University of Minnesota men's hockey team. Gambucci was signed as a free agent by the Montreal Canadiens in the spring of 1971 after scoring seven goals in ten games for Team USA at the 1971 world championships in Bern (he was also elected to the tournament all star team at the world championship \"Pool B\" qualifying tournament in 1970). The Canadiens immediately traded him and Bob Paradise to the North Stars for cash. However, Gambucci failed to become a regular in Minnesota and left the NHL for the Minnesota Fighting Saints of the rival World Hockey Association following the 1973\u201374 season. Gambucci retired from professional hockey in 1976 after playing 112 WHA regular season games for the Fighting Saints as well as representing the United States at the 1976 Ice Hockey World Championships tournament in Katowice. In basketball, a technical foul (also colloquially known as a \"T\" or a \"Tech\") is any infraction of the rules penalized as a foul which does not involve physical contact during the course of play between opposing players on the court, or is a foul by a non-player. The most common technical foul is for unsportsmanlike conduct. Technical fouls can be assessed against players, bench personnel, the entire team (often called a bench technical), or even the crowd. These fouls, and their penalties, are more serious than a personal foul, but not necessarily as serious as a flagrant foul (an ejectable offense in leagues below the NBA, and potentially so in the NBA). Tim Donaghy ( ; born January 7, 1967) is a former professional basketball referee who worked in the National Basketball Association (NBA) for 13 seasons from 1994 to 2007. During his career in the NBA, Donaghy officiated in 772 regular season games and 20 playoff games. Marc Joannette (born November 3, 1968) is a National Hockey League referee, who wears uniform number 25. As of the end of the 2007\u201308 NHL season, he has officiated 470 regular season and 28 playoff games. His first game was on October 1, 1999. He officiated on April 6, 2007 when Martin Brodeur broke Bernie Parent's single season wins record with his 48th win of the season. He was selected to officiate the 2008 and 2009 Stanley Cup Finals. He was selected to officiate the 2010 Vancouver Olympic Games in Canada. The 1983\u201384 NBA season was the 76ers' 35th season in the NBA and 21st season in Philadelphia. The 76ers entered the season as the defending NBA Champions, having won the NBA Championship the year prior, sweeping the Los Angeles Lakers in four games. The team would start fast posting 21 wins in their first 26 games but finished with a 52-30 record. The major difference was that they were just around .500 on the road for the year, unlike the previous season, where they won 30 regular season games away from Philadelphia. The 76ers would lose in the first round of the newly expanded playoff format to the New Jersey Nets, who had never won a playoff series in their NBA history to that point. The 76ers lost all three post season games at The Spectrum. Michael \"Mick\" McGeough (pronounced \"mik-GOOH\"; born June 20, 1957) is a retired National Hockey League referee, who wore uniform number 19 (now worn by Gord Dwyer) from the 1994\u201395 NHL season until his retirement. His NHL career began in 1987. McGeough was one of the last NHL officials to officiate NHL games without wearing a helmet when he was on the ice. In the 2006\u201307 NHL season, McGeough was forced by the NHL to wear a helmet on ice, as it was the first season that dictated that all on-ice officials had to do so. He now is helping the NHL bring up new recruits from the AHL. Entering the 2007\u201308 NHL season, McGeough had officiated 1,023 regular season and 63 post season games. In basketball, a flagrant foul is a serious personal foul. A foul is considered flagrant when it involves excessive or violent contact that could injure the fouled player. A flagrant foul may be unintentional or purposeful; the latter type is simultaneously known as an \"intentional foul\" in the NBA. However, most intentional fouls are not considered \"flagrant\" and are performed safely as a necessity for time management.\n\nQuestion:\nHow many regular season games did the man who wrote Personal Foul: A First-Person Account of the Scandal That Rocked the NBA officiate?\n\nPlease give the answer directly without any explanation.", "results": "772", "reasoning_chains": []}

She is known for her roles as Abbey in the British television series \"Misfits\", Fedora in ITV's television series \"Jekyll and Hyde\", and as Emelia Ricoletti in the \"Sherlock\" New Year special episode \"The Abominable Bride\". War bride is a term used in reference to foreign women who married military personnel in times of war or during their military occupations of foreign countries, especially\u2013but not exclusively\u2013during World War I and World War II. One unusual variant was the telegram war bride; and the first United States couple to do so on 17 March 1942 was the marriage of Ida West and Army Air Corps Capt. Francis Newton Culler, both of South Carolina. Ameena case is 1991 case of selling of 10 year young girl Ammena of Hyderabad, India to a person from Saudi Arabia. The child bride was rescued on August 10, 1991 by the air hostess Amrita Ahluwalia when the former was being taken to Saudi Arabia. Later it was found Badruddin and his wife Sabira Begum had sold their 10-year-old daughter Ameena into marriage for a reported $240 to a 60-year-old Saudi Arabian. The case unearthed bride shopping in Hyderabad by persons from middle east and raised a lot of attention at that time. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9s (\"Given: 1. The Waterfall, 2.

The episode was broadcast on BBC One, PBS and Channel One on 1 January 2016. It depicts the characters of the show in an alternative timeline: the Victorian London setting of the original stories by Arthur Conan Doyle. The title is based on the quote \"Ricoletti of the club foot and his abominable wife\" from \"The Adventure of the Musgrave Ritual\", which refers to a case mentioned by Holmes. The story also draws on elements of original Conan Doyle stories of Holmes such as \"The Five Orange Pips\" and \"The Final Problem\" Sherlock is a crime drama television series based on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes detective stories. Created by Steven Moffat and Mark Gatiss, it stars Benedict Cumberbatch as Sherlock Holmes and Martin Freeman as Doctor John Watson.

She was transferred to Maldivian Coast Guard on 16 April 2006 as CGS \"Huravee\". As part of the transfer, technical and material assistance was provided by the Indian Navy for a period of three years. The Indian Navy also stationed a team of personnel for a preliminary period and on-the-job training of the Maldivian crew. INS Andamans is a Nicobar class troop ship. These large multi-role troop ships were converted from merchant ships which were originally ordered by the Ministry of Shipping for service with the Shipping Corporation of India that were later acquired by the Indian Navy for troop transport duties. The ship has large davits for Landing Craft Vehicle Personnel (LCVP) and also features a high bridge forward, funnel in the aft, and a helicopter platform at the stern. This makes the vessel suitable for general purpose roles, other than just troop transport. The INS Andamans should not be confused with INS Andaman (P74), the Petya-class frigate that was lost in the Bay of Bengal in 1990 during a naval exercise, which were designated as \"Arnala\"-class\u00a0corvette s in Indian Navy due to their small size. INS Venduruthy is an Indian Navy base located on Willingdon Island near Kochi, Kerala. It serves as the Headquarters of the Southern Naval Command. It is the largest training establishment of the Indian Navy. INS Garuda is a naval air station located adjacent to INS Venduruthy. The Indian Navy (IN; : \"Bh\u0101rat\u012bya Nau Sen\u0101\") is the naval branch of the Indian Armed Forces. The President of India is the Supreme Commander of the Indian Navy. The Chief of Naval Staff, a four-star Admiral, commands the navy. INS \"Buland\" is a 25 tonne bollard pull tugboat built by Hindustan Shipyard for the Indian Navy. It is the third ship of the series of 25-ton bollard pull tugboats after INS \"Balwan\" and INS \"Sahayak\" that were built within 10 months and delivered in January 2016 in time for International Fleet Review 2016. After the sea trials, the ship was flagged off by Commander A.S. Mitra (retired), Director (Shipbuilding) on November 15, 2016 and joined the Indian Navy at its home port of Port Blair. The Indian Navy currently operates twenty-one air squadrons. Of these, ten operate fixed-wing aircraft, eight are helicopter squadrons and the remaining three are equipped with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). Building on the legacy inherited from the Royal Navy prior to Indian independence, the concept of naval aviation in India started with the establishment of Directorate of Naval Aviation at Naval Headquarters (NHQ) in early 1948. Later that year officers and sailors from the Indian Navy were sent to Britain for pilot training. In 1951, the Fleet Requirement Unit (FRU) was formed to meet the aviation requirements of the navy. On 1 January 1953, the charge of Cochin airfield was handed over to the navy from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation. On 11 March, the FRU was commissioned at Cochin with ten newly acquired Sealand aircraft. The navy's first air station, INS \"Garuda\", was commissioned two months later. From February 1955 to December 1958, ten Firefly aircraft were acquired. To meet the training requirements of the pilots, the indigenously developed HAL HT-2 trainer was inducted into the FRU. On 17 January 1959, the FRU was commissioned as Indian Naval Air Squadron (INAS) 550, to be the first Indian naval air squadron. In the following two years, three more naval air squadrons\u2014INAS 300, INAS 310 and INAS 551\u2014were commissioned. The first two operated from the newly purchased aircraft carrier INS\u00a0\"Vikrant\" flying Sea Hawks and Aliz\u00e9s, whereas the latter one, equipped with Vampires, was used for training purposes. INS \"Balshil\" is a \"Bhim\" class tugboat currently in service with the Indian Navy. The ship was delivered to the Indian Navy ahead of schedule.

INS \"Chakra\" is a 8140 t Project 971 (or Project 518; NATO: \"Akula\"-class submarine ) nuclear-powered attack submarine. The construction of the Nerpa submarine was started in 1993, but was then suspended due to lack of funding. The Indian Navy sponsored the building and sea trials of the submarine provided it was given to the Indian Navy on lease for 10 years. It was launched as \"K-152 Nerpa\" in October 2008 and entered service with the Russian Navy in late 2009. The submarine was leased to the Indian Navy in 2011 after extensive trials, and was formally commissioned into service as INS \"Chakra\" II at a ceremony in Visakhapatnam on 4 April 2012. The INS \"Chakra\" joined the Eastern Naval Command at Visakhapatnam. INS \"Viraat\" (Sanskrit: Vir\u0101\u1e6da meaning \"Giant\") was a \"Centaur\"-class aircraft carrier of the Indian Navy.

It is largely formed of barrier beaches and the silty outwash of the Cape Fear River as it drains the southeast coast of North Carolina through an estuary south of Wilmington. Cape Fear is formed by the intersection of two sweeping arcs of shifting, low-lying beach, the result of longshore currents which also form the treacherous, shifting Frying Pan Shoals, part of the Graveyard of the Atlantic. The Red Bull Cape Fear is a surfing competition held at a local Sydney break called Cape Fear, on the southern side of Botany Bay at Cape Solander. Known locally as 'Ours', it became the site of a Red Bull big wave surfing competition in August 2014 called Red Bull Cape Fear. Richie Vaculik competed against fellow local Evan Faulks. and Mark Mathews (surfer) and fellow professional surfer Ryan Hipwood organised the Red Bull Cape Fear event in August 2014. \"The Simpsons\"' fifth season originally aired on the Fox network between September 30, 1993 and May 19, 1994.

Fort Anderson is a mid 19th century earthen fort in the lower Cape Fear Region of North Carolina, located over the ruins of the colonial town of Brunswick in Brunswick County. It was used as a Confederate Fort during the American Civil War. The fort was pivotal in protecting the Cape Fear River inlets and Wilmington upstream. Earthen batteries comprise the fort and were used as platforms and shields for the Confederate cannons. Beneath some of the earthworks were \"bombproofs,\" shelters used by troops during enemy bombardment. The Confederacy decided to build forts around the Cape Fear River to protect the port of Wilmington from the Union blockade. During the Civil War, blockade runners brought supplies such as iron, guns, and ammunition to the Confederacy. The purpose of the fort was to hinder movement of Union ships, and to serve as a dropping off point for blockade runners fortunate enough to make it up the mouth of the Cape Fear River. Fort Anderson was built on the ruins of Brunswick Town and was originally named Fort St. Philip, after the ruins of the Revolutionary period church nearby. The name was changed to honor Col. George B. Anderson. \"Cape Feare\" is the second episode in the fifth season of the American animated television series \"The Simpsons\".

Cape Fear is a coastal plain and tidewater region of North Carolina centered about the city of Wilmington. The region takes its name from the adjacent Cape Fear headland, as does the Cape Fear River which flows through the region and empties into the Atlantic Ocean near the cape. Much of the region's populated areas are found along the Atlantic beaches and the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway while the rural areas are dominated by farms and swampland like that of the Green Swamp. The general area can be also identified by the titles Lower Cape Fear, Wilmington Metropolitan Area, Southeastern North Carolina, and Azalea Coast. The latter name is derived from the North Carolina Azalea Festival held annually in Wilmington. Municipalities in the area belong to the Cape Fear Council of Governments.

These protests have many causes, including civil rights, anti-conscription and anti-war, anti-nationalism, and religious reservations. \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" was adopted as the official national anthem by U.S. President Woodrow Wilson in 1916, and was made the national anthem by a congressional resolution on March 3, 1931. Before that time, a number of songs were used as unofficial national anthems, including \"My Country, 'Tis of Thee\" and \"Hail, Columbia\". Norway does not have an official national anthem, but over the last 200 years, a number of anthems have been commonly regarded as \"de facto\" national anthems. At times, multiple anthems have enjoyed this status simultaneously. Today, the anthem \"Ja, vi elsker dette landet\" is the most recognised national anthem, but until the early 20th century, \"S\u00f8nner av Norge\" occupied this position. \"\u2019Al\u0101 Khallid\u012b\" (Arabic: \u0623\u0644\u0627 \u062e\u0644\u0651\u062f\u064a\u200e \u200e ) is the former national anthem of Tunisia. It was sung during the Presidency of Habib Bourguiba until his downfall in 1987. \"Humat al-Hima\" was temporarily used as a national anthem between the end of the monarchy on 25 July 1957 and the adoption of \"Ala Khallidi\" as the official national anthem. In 1958, the Ministry of Education organized a competition, in which 53 poets and 23 musicians took part. The results were examined first by a commission of the Board of Education, which selected the submissions of the hymn poet Jalaleddine Naccache (1910\u20131989) and the composer and director of the Conservatoire of Tunis Salah El Mahdi (1925-2014). The works were presented to the president without announcing the selection that already been made. He selected the same version as the commission had. In order to be completely sure, another larger popular assembly was held in Monastir, the birth city of the president, and all 23 melodies were played. But then, the song by Naccache and El Mahdi won and was formally adopted during Independence Day, 20 March that same year. \"Jamaica, Land We Love\" is the official national anthem of Jamaica, adopted in July 1962. The anthem was chosen after a competition from September 1961 until 31 March 1962, in which, the lyrics of the national anthem were selected by Jamaica's Houses of Parliament. When Jamaica was granted independence on 6 August 1962, \"Jamaica, Land We Love\" continued to be officially used as the national anthem. \"Hail to Bermuda\" is the national song of Bermuda, written by Bette Johns. The official anthem is the national anthem of the United Kingdom, \"God Save the Queen\", as the island is a British overseas territory. \"God Save the Queen\" (alternatively \"God Save the King\", depending on the gender of the reigning monarch) is the national or royal anthem in a number of Commonwealth realms, their territories, and the British Crown Dependencies. The author of the tune is unknown and it may originate in plainchant, but a 1619 attribution to John Bull is sometimes made. The National Anthem of Bosnia and Herzegovina (Bosnian, Croatian and Serbian: \"Dr\u017eavna himna Bosne i Hercegovine\" / \u0414\u0440\u0436\u0430\u0432\u043d\u0430 \u0445\u0438\u043c\u043d\u0430 \u0411\u043e\u0441\u043d\u0435 \u0438 \u0425\u0435\u0440\u0446\u0435\u0433\u043e\u0432\u0438\u043d\u0435), is the name of the official national anthem of Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is one of the four national anthems (along with that of Kosovo, Spain and San Marino) in the world to have no official lyrics. The anthem was adopted on 25 June 1999, by the promulgation of the Law on the National Anthem of Bosnia and Herzegovina, replacing the previous anthem, \"Jedna si jedina\", which excluded the country's Serb and Croat communities, this despite the fact that the text does not mention any nationality. It was in use from 10 February 1998, as the flag and coat of arms. \"Giovinezza\" (] ; Italian for \"youth\") is the official hymn of the Italian National Fascist Party, regime, and army, and was the unofficial national anthem of Italy between 1924 and 1943. Although often sung with the official national anthem Marcia Reale, some sources consider Giovinezza to have supplanted the Royal March as the \"de facto\" national anthem (\"Inno della Patria\") of Italy, to the dismay of Victor Emmanuel III of Italy\u2014a powerful symbol of the diarchy between the King and Mussolini. It was subsequently the official anthem of the Italian Social Republic. The oldest national anthem, defined as \"a song, as of praise, devotion, or patriotism\", is the Dutch national anthem \"Het Wilhelmus\", which was written between 1568 and 1572, but not then given any official status. The first anthem to be officially proclaimed as such was \"God Save The Queen\", adopted by Great Britain in 1745. \"Het Wilhelmus\" was declared the national anthem of the Netherlands in 1932; both of these anthems remain in use today. A royal or imperial anthem is a song that is similar in patriotic character to a national anthem, but which specifically praises a monarch, or royal dynasty. Some states have doubled their royal or imperial anthem as their national anthem. Wilhelmus van Nassouwe, usually known just as the Wilhelmus (Dutch: \"Het Wilhelmus\" ; ] ; English translation: the \"William\"), is the national anthem of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. It dates back to at least 1572, making it the oldest known national anthem in the world. The national anthem of Japan, Kimigayo, has the oldest lyrics, dating from the 9th century. However, a melody was added only in the late 19th century, making it a poem rather than an anthem for most of its lifespan. Although the \"Wilhelmus\" was not recognised as the official national anthem until 1932, it has always been popular with parts of the Dutch population and resurfaced on several occasions in the course of Dutch history before gaining its present status. It was also the anthem of the Netherlands Antilles from 1954 to 1964.\n\nQuestion:\nWho is sometimes considered the author of the official national anthem of Bermuda?\n\nPlease give the answer directly without any explanation.", "results": "Bette Johns", "reasoning_chains": []}

Four teams from the former Major Indoor Soccer League participated in the first XSL season: the Chicago Storm, Detroit Ignition, Milwaukee Wave, and New Jersey Ironmen. Other former MISL teams joined the National Indoor Soccer League or Professional Arena Soccer League. The National Soccer League (NSL) was the top-level soccer league in Australia, run by Soccer Australia and later the Australian Soccer Association. The NSL, the A-League's predecessor, spanned 28 seasons from its inception in 1977 until its demise in 2004, when it was succeeded by the A-League competition run by Football Federation Australia, the successor to the Australian Soccer Association. During the history of the NSL the league was contested by a total of 42 teams; 41 based in Australia and one based in New Zealand. Seasons initially ran during the winter seasons, until 1989 when this was changed to the summer season. In 1984, the league was split into two conferences (Northern and Southern) to introduce more teams into the competition; the league returned to a single division in 1987. The competition was known by various names through sponsorships; these names included the Philips Soccer League, Olympic Airways Soccer League, Coca-Cola Soccer League, the Ericsson Cup and the A-League. Jim Gabarra (born September 22, 1959) is a retired American soccer forward who coaches the Washington Spirit National Women's Soccer League team, and previously coached Sky Blue FC and the Washington Freedom women's soccer teams.

Nicol\u00e1s An\u00edbal di Biase (born 9 December 1988) is an Argentine professional footballer who currently plays for FC Edmonton in the North American Soccer League as a midfielder. The Major Indoor Soccer League (MISL), originally known as the National Indoor Soccer League, was a professional indoor soccer league which began play in 2008. It was the third league to be known as the Major Indoor Soccer League after the MISL I and MISL II. The MISL name is arguably the most recognizable name in indoor soccer due to its history dating back to 1978. The league name and assets are currently owned by the United Soccer Leagues. The departure of six teams which joined the Professional Arena Soccer League (now the Major Arena Soccer League) after the 2013\u201314 season effectively ended the MISL. The North American Soccer League (NASL) is a professional men's soccer league with eight teams: six in the United States, one in Canada and one in Puerto Rico. It is sanctioned by the United States Soccer Federation (U.S. Soccer) as a Division II league in the United States soccer league system, under Major League Soccer (MLS) and alongside United Soccer League (formerly USL Pro). It is headquartered in New York City. Anthony Di Biase (born April 26, 1988 in Richmond Hill, Ontario) is a Canadian soccer player who played the majority of his career in North America mostly notable in the USL Second Division, USL Premier Development League, and the Canadian Soccer League. The National Premier Soccer League (NPSL) is an American soccer league commonly recognized as being a fourth tier league although it has been given no official designation by US Soccer. Although the league is officially affiliated to the United States Adult Soccer Association (USASA) and qualifies for the U.S. Open Cup through USASA channels, the league is generally considered to be at the fourth tier of competition in the United States soccer pyramid, behind Major League Soccer (MLS), the North American Soccer League (NASL), and the United Soccer League (USL), and roughly equal with the Premier Development League (PDL). It is the successor of the Men's Premier Soccer League, a regional league originally based out of the Western United States, which has now expanded nationwide to encompass teams from 29 states. The league's motto is \"A National League with a Regional Focus\". Some of the clubs are former USL clubs. Overview of the 1990 American Professional Soccer League season. Although the Western Soccer League and the American Soccer League merged to form the American Professional Soccer League in 1990, the two leagues remained essentially independent leagues, linked by name alone. During this season, they ran separate regular season schedules with two different points systems. They each had their own playoff formats, had separate league MVPs and had their own All League teams. The first game between the two leagues came in September when the Maryland Bays of the American Soccer League defeated the San Francisco Bay Blackhawks of the Western Soccer League for the American Professional Soccer League championship. Mark Snell is a retired American soccer goalkeeper who played professionally in the North American Soccer League and the Major Indoor Soccer League. He coached in the FC Dallas youth system for eight years, and is widely considered one of the top youth development coaches in the country for Zone 1 (6-12 yr olds). At FC Dallas he developed the curriculum that included teaching age appropriate tactics through small sided games. His philosophy was that the \"best train with the best\" and created the Premier team format grouping all the top players in each age group onto a team. Initially, players of all levels were scattered across many teams within each age group. Snell felt the best development model was having teams made up of \"like\" talent. That way training would be competitive for all teams regardless of talent level. He also authored and managed the street soccer based \"FCD LIGA\" which was a 3v3/4v4 in house league on Sundays. He grew the wildly successful program from 5 teams to over 30 teams to preach the small sided games format as the best player development tool. He also organized and managed the FC Dallas Development League which hosted the top U9 teams in the Dallas Metroplex.\n\nQuestion:\nNico di Biase plays for the soccer league that has how many teams?\n\nPlease give the answer directly without any explanation.", "results": "1\nA: 1", "reasoning_chains": []}

She was also the editor of the organization's newspaper, \"Freethought Today\" (published ten times per year) until 2015. Gaylor is the author of several books, including \"Woe to the Women: The Bible Tells Me So\", \"Betrayal of Trust: Clergy Abuse of Children\" and, as editor, \"Women Without Superstition: No GodsNo Masters\". She graduated from the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison's School of Journalism in 1980. A Pillar of Fire was one of the manifestations of the presence of the God of Israel in the Torah, the five books of Moses which appear at the beginning of the Old Testament Bible. According to Exodus, the pillar of fire provided light so that the Israelites could travel by night during the Exodus from Egypt (claimed to be the 18th Dynasty; see dating of the Exodus). The pillar of fire is traditionally paired with the manifestation of the divine presence by day as the Pillar of Cloud. This was so they \"could travel by day or night\". YHWH, the God of Bible, manifested himself in this pillar of fire or cloud in order to directly guide and comfort the Israelites while he rescued them from their Egyptian slavery. Throughout the Israelite's time in the desert, traveling from Egypt to Canaan (The Promised Land), YHWH continually used this pillar of fire and cloud to lead his people and remind them of his presence. When the pillar of God moved forward, the people of Israel would pack up their camp and follow behind it. Similarly, when the pillar of God's presence stopped, the Israelites would set up camp underneath it. The Tabernacle of the Lord would be set up directly underneath the cloud of the Lord. This way, God's presence was visibly in the center of the camp at all times. YHWH's holy and awesome manifestation in the cloud among the people would inspire a righteous fear as well as a blessed assurance of their safety and favor. For the Bible Tells Me So is a 2007 American documentary film directed by Daniel G.

A Biblical genre is a classification of Bible literature according to literary genre. The genre of a particular Bible passage is ordinarily identified by analysis of its general writing style, tone, form, structure, literary technique, content, design, and related linguistic factors; texts that exhibit a common set of literary features (very often in keeping with the writing styles of the times in which they were written) are together considered to be belonging to a genre. In Biblical studies, genres are usually associated with whole books of the Bible, because each of its books comprises a complete textual unit; however, a book may be internally composed of a variety of styles, forms, and so forth, and thus bear the characteristics of more than one genre (for example, chapter 1 of the Book of Revelation is prophetic/visionary; chapters 2 and 3 are similar to the epistle genre; etc.). Lake of Fire is a 2006 documentary film directed by Tony Kaye that graphically depicts abortion in the United States.

Kramer with The Dakotas. It was the sixth and final Lennon\u2013McCartney composition given to Kramer. Love Is Blue is an album by American pop singer Johnny Mathis that was released in the spring of 1968 by Columbia Records and adhered even more strictly to the concept of the \"cover\" album of recent hits than its predecessor in that five of the 10 songs selected for the project (\"I Say a Little Prayer\", \"By the Time I Get to Phoenix\", \"The Look of Love\", \"Never My Love\", and the title track) were chart hits for the original artists within the previous year and another three (\"Moon River\", \"Walk On By\", and \"Venus\") had charted within the previous decade. Even the two remaining selections that did not bring chart success to the original artists were by the hit songwriting teams of Burt Bacharach and Hal David (\"Don't Go Breakin' My Heart\") and John Lennon and Paul McCartney (\"Here, There and Everywhere\") and left no room for the usual inclusion of some original songs or material from Broadway. \"Bad to Me\" is a song credited to Lennon\u2013McCartney. In late interviews, John Lennon said that he wrote it for Billy J. Kramer with The Dakotas while on holiday in Spain. However, in a 1964 interview he said that he and Paul McCartney wrote it in the back of a van, so Paul contributed to it. Billy J. Kramer with The Dakotas released their recording of the song in 1963 and it became their first number 1 in the UK Singles Chart. Paul McCartney was present during the recording session at Abbey Road Studios. The single would be released in the US the following year, and become a top-ten hit there, reaching number 9. It became one of the first occasions a Lennon\u2013McCartney composition made the US Top 40 recorded by an artist other than the Beatles (the first being \"A World Without Love\" by Peter & Gordon; another being \"Goodbye\" by Mary Hopkin). \"Thank You Girl\" is a song recorded by the Beatles, written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney (Lennon\u2013McCartney), and issued as the B-side of the single \"From Me to You\", which was recorded on the same day (5 March 1963). While not released on an LP in the United Kingdom until \"Rarities\" in 1978, the song was the second track on \"The Beatles' Second Album\" in the United States. As the B-side of the single \"Do You Want to Know a Secret\", it hit No. 35 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 in the spring of 1964. \"One After 909\" (sometimes titled \"The One After 909\" in early recordings) is a song by the Beatles, written by John Lennon, with input from Paul McCartney (credited to Lennon\u2013McCartney), and originally released in 1970 on the album \"Let It Be\". The album version is the live performance from the rooftop concert which took place on 30 January 1969. This performance is also included in the \"Let It Be\" film. The song was written no later than spring 1960 and perhaps as early as 1957, and is one of the first Lennon\u2013McCartney compositions. \"One After 909\" is perhaps more reminiscent of early American rock 'n' roll than any of the other songs from the rooftop show, and as a joke for the rooftop chatter, Lennon sings a variant on the opening line of \"Danny Boy\" after the song is finished. \"From Me to You\" is a song written by Paul McCartney and John Lennon and released by English rock group the Beatles in 1963 as their third single. The single was the Beatles' first number one in some of the United Kingdom charts, second in others, but failed to make an impact in the United States at the time of its initial release. However, a 1963 cover version released by Del Shannon resulted in the song becoming the first Lennon\u2013McCartney tune to enter the American pop chart. Ivan Vaughan (18 June 1942 \u2013 16 August 1993) was a boyhood friend of John Lennon, and later schoolmate of Paul McCartney at the Liverpool Institute, both commencing school there in September 1953. He was born on the same day as McCartney in Liverpool. He played bass part-time in Lennon's first band, The Quarrymen, and was responsible for introducing Lennon to McCartney at a community event (the Woolton village f\u00eate) on 6 July 1957, where The Quarrymen were performing. McCartney impressed Lennon, who invited McCartney to join the band, which he did a day later. This led to the formation of Lennon and McCartney's songwriting partnership, and later of The Beatles. \"I'll Be on My Way\" is a song attributed to John Lennon and Paul McCartney, which was first released on 26 April 1963 by Billy J. Kramer with the Dakotas as the b-side of their single \"Do You Want to Know a Secret\", a song also attributed to Lennon\u2013McCartney. The single reached number two in the UK charts while \"From Me to You\" by the Beatles was occupying the number 1 position. According to Lennon, the song was written by McCartney: \"This was early Paul.\" However, there is good evidence that Lennon also contributed to the song. Compton attributes it to \"McCartney-Lennon.\" The Beatles recorded a version of the song, first released in 1994 on the \"Live at the BBC\" compilation. \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\" is a song credited to Lennon\u2013McCartney that appears on the Beatles' 1967 album \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\". It was started by John Lennon, then Paul McCartney contributed to it in a songwriting session. Lennon's son Julian inspired the song with a nursery school drawing he called \"Lucy\u2014in the sky with diamonds\". Shortly after the song's release, speculation arose that the first letter of each of the title nouns intentionally spelled \"LSD\". Lennon consistently denied this, insisting the song's fantastical imagery was inspired by Lewis Carroll's \"Alice in Wonderland\" books, a claim repeatedly confirmed by Paul McCartney. \"I've Been Good to You\" is a 1961 R&B song by The Miracles on Motown Records' Tamla label. It was released as the B-side of their \"Billboard\" Top 40 hit, \"What's So Good About Goodbye\", and was included on their album \"I'll Try Something New\" the following year. This sad, melancholy ballad charted #103 on the \"Billboard\" Pop chart. Despite its relatively modest chart placing, this song has been hugely influential, and is noted as Beatle John Lennon's favorite Miracles tune, and was the inspiration behind The Beatles' song, \"Sexy Sadie\". Written by Miracles lead singer Smokey Robinson, the song begins with the lyric, \"Look what you've done...You've made a fool out of someone...\" which Lennon later paraphrased in \"his\" song as, \"What have you done...You've made a fool of everyone.\"\n\nQuestion:\nWhat song made the American pop chart in 1963 and was on the record that had Thank You Girl by John Lennon and Paul McCartney?\n\nPlease give the answer directly without any explanation.", "results": "\"One After 909\"", "reasoning_chains": []}

The Apache scouts were the eyes and ears of the United States military and sometimes the cultural translators for the various Apache bands and the Americans. Apache scouts also served in the Navajo War, the Tonto War, the Mexican Border War and they saw stateside duty during World War II. There has been a great deal written about Apache scouts, both as part of United States Army reports from the field and more colorful accounts written after the events by non-Apaches in newspapers and books. Men such as Al Sieber and Tom Horn were sometimes in charge of small groups of Apaches. As was the custom in the United States military, scouts were enlisted with Anglo nicknames or single names. Many Apache scouts received citations for bravery. John Hartzell Spence (February 15, 1908 \u2013 May 9, 2001) was an American writer and founding editor of \"Yank, the Army Weekly\", a weekly magazine published by the United States military during World War II. He is credited with coining the term \"pinup\". Unit cohesion in the United States military it has been the subject of dispute and political debate since World War II as the United States military has expanded the categories of citizens it accepts as servicemembers. Unit cohesion is a military concept, defined by one former United States Chief of staff in the early 1980s as \"the bonding together of soldiers in such a way as to sustain their will and commitment to each other, the unit, and mission accomplishment, despite combat or mission stress\". The concept lacks a consensus definition among military analysts, sociologists, and psychologists. The Brazil\u2013United States Treaty was a military assistance agreement signed in 1952 in Rio de Janeiro between the two countries, with the goal of defending the Western Hemisphere. Military relations between the United States and Brazil date back to World War II, when Brazil supported the Allied effort in the invasion of Italy in 1942. Brazil provided troops for the invasion. On January 3, 1952, The Brazilian government issued decree 30363 establishing new government regulations. These new regulations allowed for the return of foreign capital that was invested in Brazil and profit remittances on that capital. Shortly after, representatives from the United States and representatives from Brazil started to negotiate a bilateral military assistance agreement in Rio de Janeiro on January 3, 1952. The document outlining the agreement between the two countries would be signed on March 15, 1952. The agreement went into effect on May 19, 1952. During the time of the negotiations, Major General Charles L. Mullins, Jr. negotiated a separate military plan with the Brazilian Government. The plan was approved on March 14, 1952 by the Secretary of Defense Lovett. In a private ceremony on March 15, 1952 United States Major General Mullins and Brazilian General Monteiro signed the military plan that outlined a common defense between the two nations. The agreement allowed major weapons and training by the United States military to the Brazilian military. This tenuous alliance governed the two nations bilateral ties during the events of the Cold War. However, the alliance was short lived, and suffered several major blows between the two nations during the military coup in Brazil in 1964. During this time the United States still provided military support and training to the side that supported the United States. John A. Bushemi (April 19, 1917 \u2013 February 19, 1944) was an American, best known for his service as a World War II combat photographer and filmmaker for the U.S. Army.

While working at the \"Post-Tribune\" he earned the nickname of \"One Shot\" for his abilities to capture moments on film with one click of his camera shutter. Bushemi enlisted in the army in June 1941. After taking basic training at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, he remained there as a staff photographer in its public relations office. In June 1942 Bushemi was reassigned as a staff photographer to \"Yank\", a weekly magazine for enlisted men, and was based in its editorial office in New York City. In November 1942 Bushemi was transferred to Hawaii, where he and \"Yank\" correspondent Merle Miller opened its Pacific bureau.

In modern oncology, many regimens combine several chemotherapy drugs in combination chemotherapy. The majority of drugs used in cancer chemotherapy are cytostatic, many via cytotoxicity. VAMP regimen or VAMP chemotherapy is a combination chemotherapy regimen including Vincristine. CEPP is an acronym for the name of a chemotherapy regimen that is intended for treatment of aggressive Non-Hodgkin Lymphomas. Unlike CHOP, this chemotherapy regimen does not contain doxorubicin or any other anthracycline. Thus, it can be used in patients with severe cardiovascular diseases and contraindications for doxorubicin-containing regimens. There are 2 modifications of CEPP - with the addition of bleomycin, called CEPP (B), and without bleomycin - ordinary CEPP. DT-PACE refers to a chemotherapy regimen for multiple myeloma consisting of Dexamethasone, Thalidomide, Cisplatin or Platinol, Adriamycin or doxorubicin, Cyclophosphamide, and Etoposide. ADE is a chemotherapy regimen most often used as an induction or consolidation regimen in acute myelogenous leukemia, especially in poor-risk patients or those refractory to the standard first-line induction with standard \"7+3\" regimen or who are relapsed after the standard chemotherapy.

This includes testicular cancer, ovarian cancer, cervical cancer, breast cancer, bladder cancer, head and neck cancer, esophageal cancer, lung cancer, mesothelioma, brain tumors and neuroblastoma. It is used by injection into a vein. Chemotherapy (often abbreviated to chemo and sometimes CTX or CTx) is a category of cancer treatment that uses one or more anti-cancer drugs (chemotherapeutic agents) as part of a standardized chemotherapy regimen. Chemotherapy may be given with a curative intent (which almost always involves combinations of drugs), or it may aim to prolong life or to reduce symptoms (palliative chemotherapy). Chemotherapy is one of the major categories of the medical discipline specifically devoted to pharmacotherapy for cancer, which is called \"medical oncology\". DAT in the context of chemotherapy is an acronym that means a chemotherapy regimen most often used as an induction regimen in acute myelogenous leukemia, usually for those who are refractory to the standard \"7+3\" induction regimen or who has relapsed.

The work originated as the first movement of a planned \"Revolutionary Symphony\" inspired by the July Revolution. Liszt pays homage in this programmatic symphonic poem to the soldiers and men that died fighting in revolutionary efforts. The composition of this piece was started in 1830 as a brief sketch for a full symphony, but was dropped by Liszt in the continuing of other works. However, in 1848, there was an uprising in Liszt's home country of Hungary. One of Liszt's friends was killed during this revolution, which caused Liszt to revisit his now 20 year old sketch of the Revolutionary Symphony, shortening it and forming the first movement into the commemorative H\u00e9ro\u00efde fun\u00e8bre. Liszt said of the program, \"In these successive wars and carnages, sinister sports, whatever be the colours of the flags which rise proudly and boldly against each other, on both sides they float soaked with heroic blood and inexhaustible tears. It is for Art to throw her ennobling veil over the tomb of the brave, to encircle with her golden halo the dead and dying, that they may be the envy of the living.\" \"In Flanders Fields\" is a war poem in the form of a rondeau, written during the First World War by Canadian physician Lieutenant-Colonel John McCrae. He was inspired to write it on May 3, 1915, after presiding over the funeral of friend and fellow soldier Lieutenant Alexis Helmer, who died in the Second Battle of Ypres. According to legend, fellow soldiers retrieved the poem after McCrae, initially dissatisfied with his work, discarded it. \"In Flanders Fields\" was first published on December 8 of that year in the London magazine \"Punch\". Arabella Fermor (1696\u20131737) was the daughter of a marriage between two Roman Catholic families in Protestant England, the Fermors of Oxfordshire and the Brownes of Berkshire. Her beauty was made famous by her starring role in Alexander Pope's famous poem The Rape of the Lock. After her beau Robert Petre brought about the dissolution of their engagement by stealing a lock of her hair (satirically related in the poem), Fermor married Francis Perkins of Ufton Court around 1715. She bore one daughter, Arabella, who died as a child, and five sons. Thomas Norton (c.1433-c.1513) was an English poet and alchemist. He is known as the author of the \"Ordinal of Alchemy\" (1477), an alchemical poem of around 3000 lines. According to Jonathan Hughes, Norton was born in Colne, Wiltshire. No modern town in Wiltshire is named Colne; perhaps, as Reidy reckons, Norton was born in Colerne, Wiltshire, because this fits the description in the poem of the youngest alchemist (most likely Norton) being born under a cross at the end of three shires. He became an alchemist in the 1450s, and was given the secret of the stone in 1461. Later that year he became an esquire of the body to Edward IV of England, receiving fifty marks a year, and in 1465 he was warden of Gloucester castle. He began the Ordinal in 1477. \u00c1lvaro de Campos (] ) (October 15, 1890 \u2013 November 30, 1935) was one of the poet Fernando Pessoa's various heteronyms, widely known by his powerful and wrathful writing style. According to his author, this \"alter ego\" was born in Tavira, Portugal, studied mechanical engineering and finally graduated in ship engineering in Glasgow. After a journey in Ireland, Campos sailed to the Orient and wrote his poem \"Opiario\" in the Suez Canal \"onboard\". He worked in 'Barrow-on-Furness' (sic) (of which Pessoa wrote a poem about) and Newcastle-on-Tyne (1922). Unemployed, Campos returned to Lisbon in 1926 (he wrote then the poem \"Lisbon Revisited\"), where he lived ever since. He was born in October, 1890, but Pessoa didn't put an end to the life of Campos, so he should survided his author who died in November, 1935. Campos' works may be split in three phases: the decadentist phase, the futuristic phase and the decadent (sad) phase. He chose Whitman and Marinetti as masters, showing some similarities with their works, mainly in the second phase: hymns like \"\"Ode Triunfal\"\" and \"\"Ode Mar\u00edtima\"\" praise the power of the rising technology, the strength of the machines, the dark side of the industrial civilization, and an enigmatic love for the machines. The first phase (marked by the poem \u00abOpi\u00e1rio\u00bb shared some of its pessimism with Pessoa's friend M\u00e1rio de S\u00e1-Carneiro, one of his co-workers in \"Orpheu\" magazine. In the last phase, Pessoa drops the mask, and reveals through Campos all the emptiness and nostalgy that grew during his last years of life.

In the poem, the narrator is on his or her deathbed, describing the progression of the narrator's death. Selma is a feminine name of uncertain origin. It could be a form of \"Selima\", which in turn is a name first recorded in a poem by Thomas Gray (died 1771). One possibility is that \"Selima\" was influenced by the Arabic name \"Selim\" meaning \"peace\". The Turkish name Selma is ultimately of Arabic origin. The use of \"Selma\" in Germany and Scandinavia stems from the Ossianic poetry of James Macpherson (died 1796), where it appears as a place name. Its specific popularity in Sweden is likely due to the Selma poems of Frans Michael Franz\u00e9n (died 1847). It was later introduced into Denmark by Swedish immigrants, after which it likely became more common due to the works of the author Selma Lagerl\u00f6f (died 1940). \"Beau\", also known as \"I\u2019ll Never Forget a Dog Named Beau\", is a poem written by American film and stage actor James Stewart.

La Maison Prunier became famous for its fresh fish and shellfish, brought to the restaurant daily by train from the sea, a novelty at the time. Restaurant Prunier was frequented by \"Le Beau Monde\" of the time, from kings and queens to politicians, writers and actors. When Alfred Prunier died suddenly from the stress of running the business, his son Emile Prunier (Simone's father) took over and expanded and modernised, even starting caviar farming in France when supplies from Russia dried up after the revolution. He also died young and, in 1925, the then 22-year old Simone (henceforth known as 'Madame Prunier') took over the running of the business. She had married one of her father's most promising executives and, in 1934, with the rumblings of World War II on the horizon and their wealthy clientele not travelling to Paris any more, they decided to expand the business out of France and to open a new branch in London. Many of their English clients had asked them to do so for years. Prunier St James's quickly gained a reputation for its outstanding fish dishes under the formidable, beautiful and very young Madame Prunier. Edward Prince of Wales used to walk up from St James's Palace down the road to lunch there regularly (with Mrs Simpson). Her seminal book \"A Classic Way with Fish\" was written in London and first published in 1938.

This two-part journey consisted of an open boat voyage from Elephant Island to South Georgia, and then an hike over the mountains of South Georgia to the whaling station at Stromness, where help could be sought. The Shackleton\u2013Rowett Expedition, 1921\u201322, was the last Antarctic expedition led by Sir Ernest Shackleton. Proposed as an ambitious two-year programme of Antarctic exploration it was curtailed by the death of Shackleton and the inadequacies of the expedition's ship, \"Quest\". Under the command of Frank Wild several attempts were made to break through the Antarctic pack ice, but the expedition was never able to proceed further than longitude 20\u00b0E. On the crew's return to Cape Town to refit in preparation for the second term they were ordered home. The crew of the \"Quest\" comprised 24 members in all, but only 19 were on board for the start of the Antarctic portion (Hussey accompanied Shackleton's body when it was put on board a ship for England, and Eriksen, Mooney and Bee-Mason had left before the ship reached South Georgia). Gerald Lysaght, a yachtsman, accompanied the crew from Plymouth to Cape Verde. Shackleton is a 2001 British television film written and directed by Charles Sturridge and starring Kenneth Branagh as explorer Sir Ernest Shackleton. The film tells the true story of Shackleton's 1914 Antarctic expedition on the ship \"Endurance\". The cast includes Kevin McNally, Lorcan Cranitch, Embeth Davidtz, Danny Webb, Matt Day and Phoebe Nicholls (also the director's wife) as Lady Shackleton. It was filmed in the UK, Iceland and Greenland. The film used first-hand accounts by the men on the expedition to retell the story. Shackleton biographer Roland Huntford was a production advisor. Mount Crean is one of the westernmost peaks in the dry valley region of South Victoria Land in Antarctica. It lies at , rises to 8630 ft , and is the highest summit in the Lashly Mountains. It is named after the Irish explorer Tom Crean, who was a member of both of Captain Scott's Antarctic expeditions (Discovery, 1901\u201304 and Terra Nova, 1910\u201313), and served as second officer on Sir Ernest Shackleton's Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition, 1914\u201317. Shackleton Coast is that portion of the coast along the west side of the Ross Ice Shelf between Cape Selborne and Airdrop Peak at the east side of Beardmore Glacier in Antarctica. Named by New Zealand Antarctic Place-Names Committee (NZ-APC) in 1961 after Sir Ernest Shackleton. He accompanied Scott on the southern journey during the \"Discovery\" expedition (1901\u201304) and subsequently led three Antarctic expeditions. On the British Antarctic Expedition (1907\u201309), Shackleton discovered the area beyond Shackleton Inlet to the Beardmore Glacier, and was the first to find a practicable route to the South Pole. Lack of food stopped him 97 miles (180\u00a0km) from his goal. Harbord Glacier ( ) is a glacier in Antarctica, flowing along the south side of Mount George Murray. It enters the Ross Sea south of Whitmer Peninsula where it forms Harbord Glacier Tongue. The name derives from the glacier tongue, which was named by Ernest Shackleton for A.E. Harbord, second officer of the \"Nimrod\" during the last year of the British Antarctic Expedition, 1907\u201309. Crean Glacier ( ) is a glacier 4 mi long, flowing northwest from Wilckens Peaks to the head of Antarctic Bay on the north coast of South Georgia. It was surveyed by the South Georgia Survey in the period 1951\u201357 and named by the UK Antarctic Place-Names Committee for Irishman Tom Crean, Second Officer of the \"Endurance\" during the British expedition under Ernest Shackleton, 1914\u201316. Crean accompanied Shackleton and Frank Worsley in the \"James Caird\" from Elephant Island to King Haakon Bay, South Georgia, and made the overland crossing with them to Stromness; this glacier lies on the route. Major Robert Johnston, VC (County Donegal, 13 August 1872 \u2013 Kilkenny, County Kilkenny, 24 March 1950), was an Irish rugby union player and soldier. During the Second Boer War, Johnston was awarded the Victoria Cross while serving with the Imperial Light Horse. He played rugby for both Ireland and the British Lions. He is one of three Ireland rugby union internationals to have been awarded the Victoria Cross. The other two are Tom Crean, who also served with the Imperial Light Horse in the Second Boer War, and Frederick Harvey who served in the First World War. Johnston, Crean and Harvey all played club rugby for Wanderers. In 1896 Johnston and Crean were also members of the same British Lions squad that toured South Africa The British National Antarctic Expedition, 1901\u201304, generally known as the \"Discovery\" Expedition, was the first official British exploration of the Antarctic regions since James Clark Ross's voyage sixty years earlier. Organized on a large scale under a joint committee of the Royal Society and the Royal Geographical Society (RGS), the new expedition carried out scientific research and geographical exploration in what was then largely an untouched continent. It launched the Antarctic careers of many who would become leading figures in the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration, including Robert Falcon Scott who led the expedition, Ernest Shackleton, Edward Wilson, Frank Wild, Tom Crean and William Lashly. Endurance was the three-masted barquentine in which Sir Ernest Shackleton sailed for the Antarctic on the 1914 Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition. She was launched in 1912 from Sandefjord in Norway and was crushed by ice, causing her to sink three years later in the Weddell Sea off Antarctica.\n\nQuestion:\nThe boat upon which Tom Crean served as Second Officer under Ernest Shackleton launched in 1912 from which Country?\n\nPlease give the answer directly without any explanation.", "results": "Norway", "reasoning_chains": []}

The \"Cordoba Near Eastern Research Unit\" (CNERU), is an interdepartmental and interdisciplinary unit of the Faculty of Humanities of the University of C\u00f3rdoba (Spain), which offers undergraduate and graduate courses and seminars related to all areas of Near and Middle Eastern Studies and seeks to foster knowledge of Near and Middle Eastern societies from the ancient period to the modern times. Through its academic activities CNERU also seeks to promote dialogue and understanding on the complexities of the modern Middle East. CNERU assists with and enhances the dissemination of specialized knowledge of this field through publications and media diffusion in Spanish-speaking countries and abroad. CNERU was founded in 2012 within the Faculty of Humanities of Cordoba University. The Large Underground Xenon experiment (LUX) aims to directly detect weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) dark matter interactions with ordinary matter on Earth. Despite the wealth of (gravitational) evidence supporting the existence of non-baryonic dark matter in the Universe, dark matter particles in our galaxy have never been directly detected in an experiment. LUX utilizes a 370\u00a0kg liquid xenon detection mass in a time-projection chamber (TPC) to identify individual particle interactions, searching for faint dark matter interactions with unprecedented sensitivity. Pharmacists, also known as chemists (Commonwealth English) or druggists (North American and, archaically, Commonwealth English), are healthcare professionals who practice in pharmacy, the field of health sciences focusing on safe and effective medication use. A pharmacist is a member of the health care team directly involved with patient care. Pharmacists undergo university-level education to understand the biochemical mechanisms and actions of drugs, drug uses, therapeutic roles, side effects, potential drug interactions, and monitoring parameters. This is mated to anatomy, physiology, and pathophysiology. Pharmacists interpret and communicate this specialized knowledge to patients, physicians, and other health care providers. Domain-specific learning theories of development hold that we have many independent, specialized knowledge structures, rather than one cohesive knowledge structure. Thus, training in one domain may not impact another independent domain. Technocracy is a system of governance where decision-makers are selected on the basis of technological knowledge. Scientists, engineers, technologists, or experts in any field, would compose the governing body, instead of elected representatives. Leadership skills would be selected on the basis of specialized knowledge and performance, rather than parliamentary skills. Technocracy in that sense of the word (an entire government run as a technical or engineering problem) is mostly hypothetical. In another commonly used sense, technocracy is any portion of a bureaucracy that is run by technologists.

The Transcaucasian Commissariat was established at Tbilisi on 11 November 1917, as the first government of the independent Transcaucasia following the October Revolution in Petrograd. The Commissariat decided to strengthen the Georgian\u2013Armenian\u2013Azerbaijani union by convoking a Diet or general assembly (\"Sejm\") in January 1918. The General Assembly of Cyrenaican Labor Unions was a trade union centre in Cyrenaica, Libya. Rajab al-Nayhoum was the president of the organization. Al-Nayhoum, a pioneer of the Libyan labour movement and a sailor who had acquinted trade union movements abroad, had tried to begin organizing union 1945 but had confronted problems from British authorities. After the adoption of labour legislation in 1951, al-Nayhoum set up a Port Workers Union the following year. During 1952-1953 five more unions were formed in Cyrenaica. Together the six unions formed the General Assembly of Cyrenaican Labor Unions. The General Assembly of Cyrenaican Labor Unions had around 3,000 members. An assembly hall is a kind of function hall, a large room used to hold public meetings or meetings of the members of an organization such as a school, church, or deliberative assembly. An example of the last case is the Assembly Hall (Washington, Mississippi) where the general assembly of the state of Mississippi was held. Some Christian denominations call their meeting places or places of worship assembly halls, for example the Salt Lake Assembly Hall. Elders and ministers of Presbyterian churches gather in assembly halls for their general assembly, such as in the General Assembly Hall of the Church of Scotland. The Armistice of Erzincan (also spelled Erzindzhan or Erzinjan) was an agreement to suspend hostilities during World War I signed by the Ottoman Empire and Transcaucasian Commissariat in Erzincan on 18 December 1917 (5 December O.S.). The armistice brought temporary peace to the Caucasian and Persian Fronts until 12 February, when the fighting was resumed.

It usually refers to migrations after Christopher Columbus' voyage to the Americas in 1492. For earlier American migration, see the article on: Models of migration to the New World. The 1492 light sighting was a sighting of unknown light during the first voyage of Christopher Columbus on October 11, 1492, by some crew members of \"Santa Maria\", \"Pinta\" and possibly \"Ni\u00f1a\" shortly before the landing on Guanahani. The light was reported in Columbus' journal, Ferdinand Columbus' \"Vita del Ammiraglio\" (\"The Life of the Admiral\"), the proceedings of the \"Pleitos colombinos\" (the long lawsuit involving the heirs of Columbus) and some other sources. Columbus Day is a national holiday in many countries in the Americas and elsewhere which officially celebrates the anniversary of Christopher Columbus's arrival in the Americas on October 12, 1492. The landing is celebrated as \"\"Columbus Day\"\" in the United States, as \"\"D\u00eda de la Raza\"\" (\"Day of the Race\") in many countries in Latin America, as \"\"D\u00eda de la Hispanidad\"\" and \"\"Fiesta Nacional\"\" in Spain, where it is also the religious festivity of \"la Virgen del Pilar\", as \"D\u00eda de las Am\u00e9ricas\" (Day of the Americas) in Belize and Uruguay, as \"D\u00eda del Respeto a la Diversidad Cultural\" (Day of Respect for Cultural Diversity) in Argentina, and as \"Giornata Nazionale di Cristoforo Colombo\" or \"Festa Nazionale di Cristoforo Colombo\" in Italy and in the Little Italys around the world. These holidays have been celebrated unofficially since the late 18th century and officially in various countries since the early 20th century. The Columbus Monument (Catalan: \"Monument a Colom\" , ] ; Spanish: \"Monumento a Col\u00f3n \"or\" Mirador de Col\u00f3n\" ) is a 60 m tall monument to Christopher Columbus at the lower end of La Rambla, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. It was constructed for the Exposici\u00f3n Universal de Barcelona (1888) in honor of Columbus' first voyage to the Americas. The monument serves as a reminder that Christopher Columbus reported to Queen Isabella I and King Ferdinand V in Barcelona after his first trip to the new continent. Women have made significant contributions to Latin music, a genre which predates Italian explorer Christopher Columbus' arrival in Latin America in 1492 and the Spanish colonization of the Americas. The earliest musicians were Native Americans, hundreds of ethnic groups across the continent, whose lyrics \"reflect conflict, beauty, pain, and loss that mark all human experience.\" Indigenous communities reserved music for women, who were given equal opportunities with men to teach, perform, sing, and dance. Ethnomusicologists have measured ceramic, animal-bone, and cane flutes from the Inca Empire which indicate a preference for women with a high vocal range. Women had equal social status, were trained, and received the same opportunities in music as men in indigenous communities until the arrival of Columbus in the late 15th century. European settlers brought patriarchal, machismo ideologies to the continent, replacing the idea of equality between men and women. They equated native music with \"savagery\" and European music with \"civilization\". Female musicians tended to be darker-skinned as a result of the slave trade (which increased the population of African slaves), and contemporary society denigrated music as a profession. Latin music became Africanized, with syncopated rhythms and call-and-response; European settlement introduced harmony and the Spanish d\u00e9cima song form. In 1492, a Spanish-based transatlantic maritime expedition led by Christopher Columbus encountered the Americas, a continent which was previously unknown in Europe, leading to the colonization of the Americas. Columbus Breaking the Egg is a 1752 engraving by English artist William Hogarth. Issued as the subscription ticket for his treatise on art, \"The Analysis of Beauty\", it depicts an apocryphal tale (the \"Egg of Columbus\") concerning Christopher Columbus's response to detractors of his discovery of the New World. Hogarth uses the story as a parallel to what he considered his own discoveries in art. An egg of Columbus or Columbus' egg (Italian: \"uovo di Colombo\" ] ) refers to a brilliant idea or discovery that seems simple or easy after the fact. The expression refers to an apocryphal story in which Christopher Columbus, having been told that discovering the Americas was inevitable and no great accomplishment, challenges his critics to make an egg stand on its tip. After his challengers give up, Columbus does it himself by tapping the egg on the table to flatten its tip. Christopher Columbus's journal is a diary and logbook written by Christopher Columbus about his first voyage. The journal covers events from 3 August 1492, when Columbus departed from Palos de la Frontera, to 6 November of the same year. Columbus is known by several contemporary references to have kept a journal of the voyage as a daily record of events and as an evidence for the Catholic Monarchs. Upon his return to Spain in the spring of 1493 Columbus presented the journal to Isabella I of Castile. She had it copied, retained the original, and gave the copy to Columbus before his second voyage. The whereabouts of the original Spanish text has not been known since 1504. Copies based on an abstract from the journal have been made, most notably by Bartolom\u00e9 de las Casas. \"Prayer of Columbus\" is a poem written by American poet Walt Whitman. The poem evokes the enterprising spirit of the Christopher Columbus in a God-fearing light, who rediscovered the North American continent in 1492, leading to the colonization of the Americas by the emerging European powers. Although the Viking Leif Ericson has generally been credited as having discovered the North American continent roughly 500 years earlier, Columbus' rediscovery has had a more lasting impact on the colonization trends that continued until around the onset of World War I. Thus, Whitman's poem serves as a fitting tribute to the proper explorer.\n\nQuestion:\nAn egg of Columbus or Columbus' egg, refers to a brilliant idea or discovery that seems simple or easy after the fact, the expression refers to an apocryphal story in which 1492, a Spanish-based transatlantic maritime expedition led by Christopher Columbus encountered the Americas, a continent which was previously unknown in Europe, leading to the colonization of the Americas?\n\nPlease give the answer directly without any explanation.", "results": "Yes", "reasoning_chains": []}

You will be given several paragraphs as context.  \nPlease carefully read all the information and answer the question using reasoning across the paragraphs.  \nProvide the answer directly without adding any explanation.\n\nContext:\nTransatlantic migration refers to the movement of people across the Atlantic Ocean in order to settle on the continents of North and South America. It usually refers to migrations after Christopher Columbus' voyage to the Americas in 1492. For earlier American migration, see the article on: Models of migration to the New World. The 1492 light sighting was a sighting of unknown light during the first voyage of Christopher Columbus on October 11, 1492, by some crew members of \"Santa Maria\", \"Pinta\" and possibly \"Ni\u00f1a\" shortly before the landing on Guanahani. The light was reported in Columbus' journal, Ferdinand Columbus' \"Vita del Ammiraglio\" (\"The Life of the Admiral\"), the proceedings of the \"Pleitos colombinos\" (the long lawsuit involving the heirs of Columbus) and some other sources. Columbus Day is a national holiday in many countries in the Americas and elsewhere which officially celebrates the anniversary of Christopher Columbus's arrival in the Americas on October 12, 1492. The landing is celebrated as \"\"Columbus Day\"\" in the United States, as \"\"D\u00eda de la Raza\"\" (\"Day of the Race\") in many countries in Latin America, as \"\"D\u00eda de la Hispanidad\"\" and \"\"Fiesta Nacional\"\" in Spain, where it is also the religious festivity of \"la Virgen del Pilar\", as \"D\u00eda de las Am\u00e9ricas\" (Day of the Americas) in Belize and Uruguay, as \"D\u00eda del Respeto a la Diversidad Cultural\" (Day of Respect for Cultural Diversity) in Argentina, and as \"Giornata Nazionale di Cristoforo Colombo\" or \"Festa Nazionale di Cristoforo Colombo\" in Italy and in the Little Italys around the world. These holidays have been celebrated unofficially since the late 18th century and officially in various countries since the early 20th century. The Columbus Monument (Catalan: \"Monument a Colom\" , ] ; Spanish: \"Monumento a Col\u00f3n \"or\" Mirador de Col\u00f3n\" ) is a 60 m tall monument to Christopher Columbus at the lower end of La Rambla, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. It was constructed for the Exposici\u00f3n Universal de Barcelona (1888) in honor of Columbus' first voyage to the Americas. The monument serves as a reminder that Christopher Columbus reported to Queen Isabella I and King Ferdinand V in Barcelona after his first trip to the new continent. Women have made significant contributions to Latin music, a genre which predates Italian explorer Christopher Columbus' arrival in Latin America in 1492 and the Spanish colonization of the Americas. The earliest musicians were Native Americans, hundreds of ethnic groups across the continent, whose lyrics \"reflect conflict, beauty, pain, and loss that mark all human experience.\" Indigenous communities reserved music for women, who were given equal opportunities with men to teach, perform, sing, and dance. Ethnomusicologists have measured ceramic, animal-bone, and cane flutes from the Inca Empire which indicate a preference for women with a high vocal range. Women had equal social status, were trained, and received the same opportunities in music as men in indigenous communities until the arrival of Columbus in the late 15th century. European settlers brought patriarchal, machismo ideologies to the continent, replacing the idea of equality between men and women. They equated native music with \"savagery\" and European music with \"civilization\". Female musicians tended to be darker-skinned as a result of the slave trade (which increased the population of African slaves), and contemporary society denigrated music as a profession. Latin music became Africanized, with syncopated rhythms and call-and-response; European settlement introduced harmony and the Spanish d\u00e9cima song form. In 1492, a Spanish-based transatlantic maritime expedition led by Christopher Columbus encountered the Americas, a continent which was previously unknown in Europe, leading to the colonization of the Americas. Columbus Breaking the Egg is a 1752 engraving by English artist William Hogarth. Issued as the subscription ticket for his treatise on art, \"The Analysis of Beauty\", it depicts an apocryphal tale (the \"Egg of Columbus\") concerning Christopher Columbus's response to detractors of his discovery of the New World. Hogarth uses the story as a parallel to what he considered his own discoveries in art. An egg of Columbus or Columbus' egg (Italian: \"uovo di Colombo\" ] ) refers to a brilliant idea or discovery that seems simple or easy after the fact. The expression refers to an apocryphal story in which Christopher Columbus, having been told that discovering the Americas was inevitable and no great accomplishment, challenges his critics to make an egg stand on its tip. After his challengers give up, Columbus does it himself by tapping the egg on the table to flatten its tip. Christopher Columbus's journal is a diary and logbook written by Christopher Columbus about his first voyage. The journal covers events from 3 August 1492, when Columbus departed from Palos de la Frontera, to 6 November of the same year. Columbus is known by several contemporary references to have kept a journal of the voyage as a daily record of events and as an evidence for the Catholic Monarchs. Upon his return to Spain in the spring of 1493 Columbus presented the journal to Isabella I of Castile. She had it copied, retained the original, and gave the copy to Columbus before his second voyage. The whereabouts of the original Spanish text has not been known since 1504. Copies based on an abstract from the journal have been made, most notably by Bartolom\u00e9 de las Casas. \"Prayer of Columbus\" is a poem written by American poet Walt Whitman. The poem evokes the enterprising spirit of the Christopher Columbus in a God-fearing light, who rediscovered the North American continent in 1492, leading to the colonization of the Americas by the emerging European powers. Although the Viking Leif Ericson has generally been credited as having discovered the North American continent roughly 500 years earlier, Columbus' rediscovery has had a more lasting impact on the colonization trends that continued until around the onset of World War I. Thus, Whitman's poem serves as a fitting tribute to the proper explorer.\n\nQuestion:\nAn egg of Columbus or Columbus' egg, refers to a brilliant idea or discovery that seems simple or easy after the fact, the expression refers to an apocryphal story in which 1492, a Spanish-based transatlantic maritime expedition led by Christopher Columbus encountered the Americas, a continent which was previously unknown in Europe, leading to the colonization of the Americas?\n\nPlease give the answer directly without any explanation.", "results": "Christopher Columbus", "reasoning_chains": []}

A practical test, more commonly known as a checkride, is the Federal Aviation Administration examination which one must undergo in the United States to receive an aircraft pilot's certification, or an endorsement for additional flight privileges. The name refers to the portion of the examination in which the candidate being examined flies in an aircraft with the Designated Pilot Examiner or other authorized examiner to demonstrate competency in the skills that are required for the certification. Although \"checkride\" is the most commonly used term, it is considered informal and is technically known as a Practical Test by the FAA and in all its literature, and the specific objectives which the candidate must meet are called the Practical Test Standards, or PTS.

It was released by Warner Bros. Records on March 26, 2012, to coincide with the release of her twelfth studio album, \"MDNA\". The eleven-disc box set was released in Europe and Japan, and included all of Madonna's studio albums from the years 1983 to 2008. The album artwork consisted of a collage of the album covers, housed in a gold box, it also included a Parental Advisory sticker due to the original version of the albums \"Erotica\" (1992) and \"American Life\" (2003). On the same date, Warner Bros. released and reprinted another box set titled \"Madonna: Original Album Series\" which included five discs. Chrome, Smoke & BBQ is a box set by American blues-rock band ZZ Top, released in 2003. At the time of release, this box set was notable for using the original mixes for all of the tracks from the band's first five albums for the first time on the CD format. This box set, and the companion release \"Rancho Texicano\", were the only two CD releases which featured original mixes from \"ZZ Top's First Album\", \"Rio Grande Mud\", and \"Tejas\", aside from 1977's \"The Best of ZZ Top\" which features two tracks from \"Rio Grande Mud\" and one track from \"First Album\". \"Tres Hombres\" and \"Fandango!\" were reissued in their original mixes in 2006, and in 2013, Warner Brothers released the CD box set 'The Complete Studio Albums 1970-1990' which includes the first ten ZZ Top studio albums, all with the original mixes. The Studio Albums 1992\u20132011 is an eleven compact disc box set by American progressive metal/rock band Dream Theater, released by Roadrunner on July 8, 2014. It contains ten of the original thirteen Dream Theater studio albums; as the title indicates, the box set spans the years from 1992 to 2011, and does not include the band's 1989 debut album \"When Dream and Day Unite\" or their self-titled twelfth studio album, which was released ten months before the box set. The albums are placed in chronological order. Brian Patrick Carroll (born May 13, 1969), known professionally as Buckethead, is an American musician who has worked within many genres of music. He has released 300 studio albums, four special releases, and one EP. He has also performed on more than 50 other albums by other artists. His music spans many diverse areas such as progressive metal, funk, blues, bluegrass, ambient, and avant-garde music. Radiohead Box Set is a box set of the first six studio albums and one live album by the English rock band Radiohead, released on 10 December 2007. The box set is available as a seven CD box set, a digital download and a 4GB USB Stick. The box set peaked at #95 in Canada's album charts. Buckethead is an American musician, predominantly a guitarist. The following is a discography of works by Buckethead, which currently consists of 302 studio albums (including 272 Pikes), 1 live album, 4 special releases, 1 extended play, 5 demo tapes, 3 solo DVD video releases, 2 DVD video releases with Cornbugs, 3 music videos, 3 unreleased albums, 3 solo videography releases, and 16 videography releases with other artists.

Led Zeppelin Boxed Set 2 is a double album released by Atlantic Records on 21 September 1993. This box set features the rest of the English rock band Led Zeppelin's catalogue not included in the 1990 4-CD box set \"Led Zeppelin\", all digitally remastered, including the previously unreleased studio track \"Baby Come On Home\". A 54-page booklet was also included with the release. Between this box set and the 4-CD box set every track from the band's nine studio albums are featured along with two BBC live recordings; the band's only non-LP b-side; and one studio outtake. Monolith is a box set made by avant-garde music composer Buckethead under the name of Death Cube K (an anagram of Buckethead), released in December 2007 through TDRS Music. Trash Box is a 5-CD box set of mid-1960s garage rock and psychedelic rock recordings, primarily by American bands. This box set is similar to the earlier \"Pebbles Box\" (a 5-LP box set) and includes almost all of the same recordings in that box set (and in the same order), along with numerous bonus tracks at the end of each disc. Supposedly, \"the Trash Box\" collects the first five volumes of the CDs in the Pebbles series (i.e., those released by AIP Records, not to be confused with the 4 earlier CDs that were issued by ESD Records). However, as is generally true of the CD reissues of these five volumes (though not nearly to the same extent), the tracks differ significantly on all five discs as compared to both the original Pebbles LPs and the later Pebbles CDs in the corresponding volumes; and the surf rock rarities on \"Pebbles, Volume 4\" have been eschewed entirely. Overall, there are 109 tracks in the box set (excluding the introduction and ending cuts) as compared to 101 songs on the individual CDs and 72 tracks in the \"Pebbles Box\". Although most of the recordings on \"the Trash Box\" were released at some point on one of the individual Pebbles albums, several of the songs have not appeared elsewhere in the Pebbles series. Inexplicably, one of these songs is the well-known hit \"I Fought the Law (but the Law Won)\" by the Bobby Fuller Four (on Disc Four) \u2013 which is also included in the \"Pebbles Box\" \u2013 in place of the much rarer \"Wine Wine Wine\" by Bobby Fuller that appears on \"Pebbles, Volume 2\". Four Light Years is a box set of three studio albums by Electric Light Orchestra (ELO). It was released in 1980 by Jet Records.vThe box contained three albums: \"A New World Record\" (1976), the double album \"Out of the Blue\" (1977), and \"Discovery\" (1979). Each album was a large commercial success in its own right, but unlike \"Three Light Years\" it did not chart as a combined collection on the UK Albums Chart. The set was so-titled because it covered four years, contained four vinyl records, and was a sequel to \"Three Light Years\" (1978). A proposed \"Across the Border\" EP was meant to promote the box set but was withdrawn. The EP version of the song would later turn up on the 1997 singles compilation \"Light Years\".\n\nQuestion:\nMonolith is a box set by what composer who has released 300 studio albums, four special releases, and one EP?\n\nPlease give the answer directly without any explanation.", "results": "Buckethead", "reasoning_chains": []}

Director Dario Argento had originally contacted jazz pianist and composer Giorgio Gaslini to score the film, but he was unhappy with his output, deeming it \"awful\". After failing to get Pink Floyd to write music for the film, Argento turned back to Italy and found Goblin. In the final score, only three of Gaslini's original themes were retained; however, in the film's original theatrical release, Gaslini was given full composer credit for the entire score, while Goblin were wrongly credited only as performers [i.e. \"Music by Giorgio Gaslini, performed by Goblin\"].

A week earlier, on 27 June, an Air France plane with 248 passengers had been hijacked by two members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine \u2013 External Operations (PFLP-EO) under orders of Wadie Haddad (who had earlier broken away from the PFLP of George Habash), and two members of the German Revolutionary Cells. The hijackers had the stated objective to free 40 Palestinian and affiliated militants imprisoned in Israel and 13 prisoners in four other countries in exchange for the hostages. The flight, which had originated in Tel Aviv with the destination of Paris, was diverted after a stopover in Athens via Benghazi to Entebbe, the main airport of Uganda.

Russell (1844 \u2013 June 7, 1910) was an American Corporal in the U.S. Army who served with the 93rd New York Volunteer Infantry during the American Civil War. He received the Medal of Honor for extraordinary heroism after capturing the flag of the 42nd Virginia Infantry during the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House. He received the Medal of Honor on December 1, 1864. The history of the United States Army began in 1775. From its formation, the United States Army has been the primary land based part of the United States Armed Forces. The Army's primary responsibility has been the fighting of land battles and military occupation. The Corps of Engineers has a major role in controlling rivers inside the United States. The Continental Army was founded in response to a need for professional soldiery in the American Revolutionary War in order to fight the invading British Army. Until the 1940s, the Army was relatively small in peacetime. In 1947, the Air Force became completely independent from the Army Air Forces. The Army was under the control of the War Department until 1947, and the Defense Department since then. The U.S. Army fought the War of 1812 (1812\u201315), American Civil War (1861\u201365), Spanish\u2013American War (1898), World War I (1917\u201318), World War II (1941\u201345), Korean War (1950\u201353) and Vietnam War (1965\u201371).

In the beginning of the Syrian Civil War, Turkey trained defectors of the Syrian Army on its territory, and in July 2011, a group of them announced the birth of the Free Syrian Army, under the supervision of Turkish intelligence. In October 2011, Turkey began sheltering the Free Syrian Army, offering the group a safe zone and a base of operations. Together with Saudi Arabia and Qatar, Turkey has also provided the rebels with arms and other military equipment. Tensions between Syria and Turkey significantly worsened after Syrian forces shot down a Turkish fighter jet in June 2012, and border clashes erupted in October 2012. On 24 August 2016, the Turkish armed forces began a declared direct military intervention into Syria pursuing as targets both ISIL and the Kurdish-aligned forces in Syria.

Acrobatic Rock'n'Roll is a very athletic, competitive form of partner dance that originated from lindy hop. Unlike lindy hop, however, it is a choreographed dance designed for performance. It is danced by both couples (usually of mixed gender) and groups, either all-female or four to eight couples together. This is normally a very fast and physically demanding dance.

In electronics, rapid single flux quantum (RSFQ) is a digital electronics that uses superconducting devices, namely Josephson junctions, to process digital signals. In RSFQ logic, information is stored in the form of magnetic flux quanta and transferred in the form of Single Flux Quantum (SFQ) voltage pulses. RSFQ is one family of superconducting or SFQ logic. Others include Reciprocal Quantum Logic (RQL), ERSFQ - energy-efficient RSFQ version that does not use bias resistors, etc. Josephson junctions are the active elements for RSFQ electronics, just as transistors are the active elements for semiconductor electronics. RSFQ is a classical digital, not quantum computing, technology. James Marcus \"Lindy\" Hood (July 30, 1907 \u2013 October 17, 1972) was a college basketball All-American center for the University of Alabama. At Alabama, Hood is noted for being their first All-American men's basketball player in 1931 and as the leader of the undefeated 1929\u201330 Crimson Tide squad. Hood's nickname \"Lindy\" came during his playing days with Alabama during a trip to New Orleans to play Tulane. As he entered a hotel lobby, a crowd mistook Hood for Charles Lindbergh and thus the nickname \"Lindy\" was given to him. Hood was posthumously inducted into the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame in 1990.\n\nQuestion:\nQuanta Magazine and Lindy's Sports, are which form of publication?\n\nPlease give the answer directly without any explanation.", "results": "A magazine", "reasoning_chains": []}

Sam Abell (born 1945 in Sylvania, Ohio) is an American photographer known for his frequent publication of photographs in \"National Geographic\". He first worked for \"National Geographic\" in 1967, and is one of the more overtly artistic photographers among his magazine peers. Sam Abell's style of photography is documentary in the sense that his major avenue, the \"National Geographic\" magazine, is a publication of record. However, his best work is known for its transcendent qualities, starting at the documentary level yet open to interpretation on an aesthetic level. One of his favorite photographs (based on how often he mentions it when asked about his work) is of the tree viewed through a Japanese window, which graces the cover of his book \"Seeing Gardens\". It's a documentary photograph of a tree, but due to a combination of light and Abell's inclusion in his composition of roof tiles in the background, the photograph takes on the transcendent, illusory quality of a stained glass window. Abell rarely uses flash, preferring a pure relationship with light. He has said that he could be perfectly happy with his photography even if his only subject was light itself. Clifford Joseph Harris Jr. (born September 25, 1980), known professionally as T.I. and Tip (often stylized as TIP or T.I.P.), is an American rapper and actor from Atlanta, Georgia.

Upon being released from Arista, Harris signed to Atlantic and subsequently became the co-chief executive officer (CEO) of his own label imprint, Grand Hustle Records, which he launched in 2003. Harris is also perhaps best known as one of the artists who popularized the hip hop subgenre trap music, along with Young Jeezy and Gucci Mane.

It uses gamma spectroscopy with room temperature NaI detectors, and QCC, Quadratic Compression Conversion, algorithms to identify multiple isotopes in realtime and below background (it subtracts the background). The SAM, surveillance and monitoring, is able to capture even transient phenomenon such as in portal situations because it captures spectra in short time segments and produces a response from spectra with each time segment. Conversely, if the SAM is in a moving vehicle, it can quickly scan an area as the vehicle moves. The first line responder can email the SAM 935 data report for further analysis. \"For Your Country and My Country\" is a World War I era song released in 1917.

The former novel ends with the suicide of Pearl\u2019s husband Sam and the shattering discovery by Joy that May is really her mother, Pearl is her aunt, and Z.G., the famous Chinese artist, is her father. Joy's guilt-driven journey to China to find her father and Pearl's loving pursuit are placed in the context of the tumult and suffering of Mao's China\u2014especially in the context of the horrific famine caused by Mao's misguided Great Leap Forward.

He was elected to the Indiana Superintendent of Public Instruction in 1854 (Osborne 1932, p.\u00a068), and he remained on the faculty of Wabash College until his death in 1880 (Osborne 1932, p.\u00a0144). Benjamin A. Rogge (June 18, 1920 \u2013 November 17, 1980) was an American economist, college administrator, and libertarian writer, speaker and foundation advisor. Rogge received an A.B. degree from Hastings College and an M.A. from the University of Nebraska Lincoln. Rogge received his PhD in economics from Northwestern. At Wabash College, Rogge taught in the summer Institute for Professional Development, in addition to his usual teaching in economics. Rogge co-authored an economics principles textbook with John Van Sickle. One strength of the text is the account that it gives of Joseph Schumpeter's process of creative destruction. Rogge helped organize a series of lectures by Milton Friedman at Wabash that were eventually developed into Friedman's \"Capitalism and Freedom\" book. Much later, Rogge participated in a brainstorming session for Friedman's Free to Choose television series. Liberty Fund was founded with money from Pierre Goodrich, who sought advice from Rogge during the Fund's early years. Rogge served for many years as a Liberty Fund trustee. Thomas Sowell gives Rogge credit for encouraging him to write a book on economics and race. Rogge also was a frequent presenter at the seminars of the Foundation for Economic Education (FEE). FEE's founder, Leonard Read, thought of Rogge as Read's eventual successor, an outcome prevented by Read outliving Rogge. An extended (but somewhat grainy) video clip of a Rogge FEE lecture on \"Competition and Monopoly\" on YouTube illustrates the dry wit that made him a popular speaker. Rogge attended 13 meetings of the influential international Mont Pelerin Society. Rogge helped produce, and narrated, a documentary on Adam Smith that was funded by Liberty Fund. Rogge wrote the introduction to a collection of quotations from Adam Smith. A collection of Rogge's speeches, often on topics in economics or education, was published under the title \"Can Capitalism Survive?\" Wabash College, where he taught for many years, established a speaker series in his honor. Rogge's archives are mainly housed at the Hoover Institute on the campus of Stanford University. A posthumous collection of Rogge's speeches and essays has appeared under the title \"A Maverick's Defense of Freedom\". William H. Spaulding (May 4, 1880 \u2013 October 12, 1966) was an American football player and coach of football, basketball, and baseball. Spaulding coached at UCLA from 1925 to 1938. He had a successful tenure, compiling a 72\u201351\u20138 ( ) record. He also served as the head football coach at the University of Minnesota from 1922 to 1924. His record there was 11\u20137\u20134 ( ). He succeeded the legendary football coach Henry L. Williams. Prior to coaching at Minnesota he coached Western State Normal School (now known as Western Michigan University) from 1907 to 1921. Spaulding was the head football, basketball and baseball at Western State Normal. Spaulding attended Wabash College, where he played college football. In 1984, he was inducted into the Wabash College Athletic Hall of Fame. Christopher William Creighton (born February 7, 1969) is an American football coach and former player. He is currently the head coach at Eastern Michigan University, a position he has held since the 2014 season. Creighton served as the head coach at Ottawa University from 1997 to 2000 and at Wabash College from 2001 to 2007 before moving to Drake University for the 2008 through 2013 seasons. The 1884 Wabash College football team represented Wabash College during the 1884 college football season (The team would not garner the nickname \"Little Giants\" until late in its 1904 football season). The Wabash Little Giants are the intercollegiate athletics teams that represent Wabash College, a small private school for men in Crawfordsville, Indiana, United States. The college belongs to the National Collegiate Athletic Association and participates in Division III sports. The Little Giants compete as members of the North Coast Athletic Conference. Despite the college's small enrollment and that it is \"not a jock school\", the Little Giants have had success in several sports. The most popular among Wabash fans are football and swimming. The Little Giants also have a well-respected cross-country team. In football, Wabash has an important rivalry with DePauw University, and each season they meet for the Monon Bell Classic. Wabash and DePauw compete annually to win the trophy, the Monon Bell, and as of 2015 the two teams have played 122 games in the series with Wabash holding a 60-53-9 advantage.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat state Christopher William Creighton work in before moving to Wabash College?\n\nPlease give the answer directly without any explanation.", "results": "Kansas", "reasoning_chains": []}

It is based on Python and wxWidgets, making it platform-independent in principle. It functions on all 32-bit versions of Microsoft Windows (95/98/NT/2000/XP), POSIX (Linux/BSD/UNIX-like OSes) and, to a limited extent, Mac OS X. Bibus is free software released under the GNU GPL v2+. HomeBank is a personal accounting software package that runs on OpenBSD, Linux, FreeBSD, Microsoft Windows, Mac OS (via macports or homebrew) and AmigaOS. Homebrew is a free and open-source software package management system that simplifies the installation of software on Apple's macOS operating system. Originally written by Max Howell, the package manager has gained popularity in the Ruby on Rails community and earned praise for its extensibility. Homebrew has been recommended for its ease of use as well as its integration into the command line. MacPorts, formerly called DarwinPorts, is a package management system that simplifies the installation of software on the macOS and Darwin operating systems. It is an open-source software project to simplify installation of other open source software. Similar in aim and function to Fink and the BSDs' ports collections, DarwinPorts was started in 2002 as part of the OpenDarwin project, with the involvement of a number of Apple Inc. employees including Landon Fuller, Kevin Van Vechten, and Jordan Hubbard. Ports collections (or \"ports trees\", or just \"ports\") are the sets of makefiles and patches provided by the BSD-based operating systems, FreeBSD, NetBSD, and OpenBSD, as a simple method of installing software or creating binary packages. They are usually the base of a package management system, with ports handling package creation and additional tools managing package removal, upgrade, and other tasks. In addition to the BSDs, a few Linux distributions have implemented similar infrastructure, including Gentoo's Portage, Arch's Arch Build System (ABS), CRUX's Ports and Void Linux's Templates. Microsoft Small Business Financials (formerly Microsoft Small Business Manager) is a business accounting software package. The software is targeting growing small businesses that require more than basic accounting software: with fewer than 25 employees and less than $10 million of revenue. It is part of Microsoft Dynamics (formerly Microsoft Business Solutions) family. It is based on Microsoft Dynamics GP and runs on top of free Microsoft MSDE or SQL Server Express database. Microsoft Small Business Financials and Microsoft Dynamics GP are built on the same platform, so migration to Microsoft Dynamics GP is very simple and straightforward. Open Systems Accounting Software (OSAS) is a business accounting software package for small- to medium-sized businesses using the Microsoft Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X operating systems. It has been developed and sold since 1976 by Open Systems, Inc. of Shakopee, MN. Pristine Sources is a software management concept coined by the developers of the short-lived Bogus Linux distribution and popularized by Marc Ewing, co-founder of Red Hat Inc, after he adopted it and RPM Package Manager as a development philosophy for Red Hat Linux. It was the concept that enabled Red Hat to build Linux distributions faster and more reliably than had been possible previously. Briefly, the problem with building an operating systems out of the myriad pieces of open source (or free software) components available from teams across the Internet was that there were many of these components and they all upgraded on different schedules at different times. Ewing's insight was to recognize that he could not take responsibility for these components. He and Erik Troan, wanted to build a software package management system, RPM, that allowed the team at Red Hat to avoid changing any of the source code of the software components they needed to use to build their Red Hat Linux operating system. The OpenBSD Cryptographic Framework (OCF) is a service virtualization layer for the uniform management of cryptographic hardware by an operating system.

Born in Tipperary, he was knighted in the 1920 New Year Honours for his services to Newcastle. He founded the Sir John Fitzgerald pub chain that bears his name and is still owned and operated by his descendants. The John Fitzgerald Kennedy Memorial is a monument to U.S. President John Fitzgerald Kennedy in the West End Historic District of downtown Dallas, Texas (USA) erected in 1970, and designed by noted architect Philip Johnson. John FitzGerald, de facto 12th Earl of Desmond (d. 1536) was the brother of Thomas FitzGerald, 11th Earl of Desmond. Upon his brother's death in 1534, John disputed the title to the earldom of his brother's grandson, James FitzGerald, de jure 12th Earl of Desmond. John died in 1536. His grandnephew, the de jure earl, died in 1540, and was succeeded by John's son, James FitzGerald, 14th Earl of Desmond. The John Fitzgerald Kennedy National Historic Site is the birthplace and childhood home of John Fitzgerald Kennedy, the 35th President of the United States. The house is located at 83 Beals Street in the Coolidge Corner neighborhood of Brookline, Massachusetts.

Perry won three consecutive Wimbledon Championships from 1934 to 1936 and was World Amateur number one tennis player during those three years. Prior to Andy Murray in 2013, Perry was the last British player to win the men's Wimbledon championship, in 1936, and the last British player to win a men's singles Grand Slam title until Andy Murray won the 2012 US Open.

Murray then made it to the final of the Dubai Tennis Championships defeating Novak Djokovic in the semifinals, only to lose to Roger Federer in the final. After a loss in his opening match in Indian Wells, Murray made it to the final of the Miami Masters for the second time, where he was ultimately defeated by Djokovic in the final. Murray's clay court season was hampered by a back injury, meaning he didn't make it beyond the quarterfinals of any event, ultimately losing to David Ferrer in the last eight at Roland Garros. During the summer, Murray made it to his first ever final at Wimbledon, in which he was ultimately defeated by Federer in four sets. Murray however made his most impressive of comebacks from a Grand Slam final defeat, at the London Olympics four weeks later, staged once again at the All-England Club. Murray made it through to the final with ease, including a straight sets defeat of Novak Djokovic, to set up a rematch with Federer, once again on Wimbledon Centre Court.

His mother was the immortal nereid Thetis, and his father, the mortal Peleus, was the king of the Myrmidons. Pkharmat (Chechen: \u041f\u0445\u044c\u0430\u0440\u043c\u0430\u0442, P\u1e8barmat , Creator of the nation, language or land) is a legendary hero of the Vainakh people who brought fire to mankind and was chained to the Mount Kazbek. This allowed them to forge metal, cook and illuminate their houses. As a result of this, the people united and became a nation. Pkharmat is the Vainakh equivalent of the Greek hero Prometheus and the Georgian mythology hero Amirani, among others. In Greek mythology, Lyrnessus was a town or city in Dardania (Asia minor), inhabited by Cilicians. It was closely associated with the nearby Cilician Thebe. At the time of the Trojan War, it was said to have been ruled by a king named Mynes. His widowed wife is Briseis, who later became a prize of Achilles. Ithaka is a 1996 play by the German writer Botho Strau\u00df. It has the subtitle \"Schauspiel nach den Heimkehr-Ges\u00e4ngen der Odyssee\", meaning \"play after the homecoming songs from the \"Odyssey\"\". It tells the story of how Odysseus, the Greek hero from the Trojan War, returns after 20 years to his court in Ithaca, where he massacres the suitors of his wife Penelope to recreate order. Heraclea Lyncestis also spelled Herakleia Lynkestis (Greek: \u1f29\u03c1\u03ac\u03ba\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 \u039b\u03c5\u03b3\u03ba\u03b7\u03c3\u03c4\u03af\u03c2 ; Latin: \"Heraclea Lyncestis\" ; Macedonian: \u0425\u0435\u0440\u0430\u043a\u043b\u0435\u0430 \u041b\u0438\u043d\u043a\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0441 , was an ancient Greek city in Macedon, ruled later by the Romans. Its ruins are situated 2\u00a0km south of the present-day town of Bitola, Macedonia. It was founded by Philip II of Macedon in the middle of the 4th century BC. The city was named in honor of the mythological Greek hero Heracles. The name \"Lynkestis\" originates from the name of the ancient kingdom, conquered by Philip, where the city was built. Operas based on the Orphean myths, and especially the story of Orpheus' journey to the underworld to rescue his wife, Eurydice, were amongst the earliest examples of the art form and continue to be written into the 21st century. Orpheus, the Greek hero whose songs could charm both gods and wild beasts and coax the trees and rocks into dance, has achieved an emblematic status as a metaphor for the power of music. The following is an annotated list of operas (and works in related genres) based on his myth. The works are listed with their composers and arranged by date of first performance. In cases where the opera was never performed, the approximate date of composition is given. Chaon (Greek: \u03a7\u03ac\u03c9\u03bd , gen.: \u03a7\u03ac\u03bf\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2) was a Greek hero and the eponymous ancestor of the Chaonians who gave his name to Chaonia, a district in northwestern Epirus in Greece. The stories are unclear as to whether he was the friend or the brother of Helenus, but in either case, he accompanied him to the court of Neoptolemus. The stories concerning Chaon's death are as unclear as that of his relationship to Helenus. Chaon was either killed in a hunting accident or offered himself as a sacrifice to the gods during an epidemic, thus saving the lives of his countrymen. In either case, when Helenus became the ruler of the country, he named a part of the kingdom after Chaon. Achilles on Skyros is an episode in the myth of Achilles, a Greek hero of the Trojan War. Not existing in Homer's epic poem \"Iliad\", the episode is written down in detail in some later versions of the story, particularly the \"Achilleid\" by the Roman poet Statius. The story of how Achilles disguised himself as a girl at the court of the king of Skyros, fell in love with one of the princesses, and married her before leaving for Troy, became a popular topic in arts and literature from Classical times until the middle of the 20th century. The carnavalesque disguises and gender transpositions at the heart of the story were particularly popular in opera, with over 30 different operas on the theme between 1641 and 1857. Stepan Fyodorovich Shutov (Russian: \u0421\u0442\u0435\u043f\u0430\u043d \u0424\u0451\u0434\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0428\u0443\u0442\u043e\u0432; 30 January 1902 \u2013 17 April 1963) was a Red Army Colonel and double Hero of the Soviet Union. Shutov fought in the Russian Civil War and the Polish\u2013Soviet War. He was demobilized after recovering from Typhus in 1921 but was drafted into the Red Army again in 1924.

You will be given several paragraphs as context.  \nPlease carefully read all the information and answer the question using reasoning across the paragraphs.  \nProvide the answer directly without adding any explanation.\n\nContext:\nAmica is an opera in two acts by Pietro Mascagni, originally composed to a libretto by Paul B\u00e9rel (the pseudonym of Paul de Choudens). The only opera by Mascagni with a French libretto, it was an immediate success with both the audience and the critics on its opening night at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Casino in Monte-Carlo on 16 March 1905. Mascagni himself conducted the performance. The opera had its Italian premiere (with an Italian libretto by Mascagni's close collaborator, Giovanni Targioni-Tozzetti) on 13 May 1905 at the Teatro Costanzi in Rome. This is a discography of Cavalleria rusticana, an opera by Pietro Mascagni. It premiered at the Teatro Costanzi in Rome on 17 May 17, 1890. There have been over 100 full-length recordings of \"Cavalleria rusticana\" published since it was first recorded in Germany in 1909. Mascagni himself has conducted the opera in two recordings, the best-known of which is the 1940 EMI recording made to mark the 50th anniversary of the opera's premiere. The performance by the La Scala orchestra and chorus with Lina Bruna Rasa as Santuzza and Beniamino Gigli as Turiddu also has a spoken introduction by Mascagni. Originally released as an LP, it is available on CD under several historical recording labels, including Naxos. Lina Bruna Rasa (24 September 1907 \u2013 October 1984) was an Italian operatic soprano. She was particularly noted for her performances in the verismo repertoire and was a favourite of Pietro Mascagni who considered her the ideal Santuzza. Bruna Rasa created the roles of Atte in Mascagni's \"Nerone\", Cecilia Sagredo in Franco Vittadini's \"La Sagredo\" and Saint Clare in 's 1926 oratorio, \"Trittico Francescano\". She also sang the role of Tsaritsa Militrisa in the Italian premiere of Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov's \"The Tale of Tsar Saltan\". Monsignor Lorenzo Perosi (21 December 1872 \u2013 12 October 1956) was an Italian composer of sacred music and the only member of the Giovane Scuola who did not write opera. In the late 1890s, while he was still only in his 20s, Perosi was an internationally celebrated composer of sacred music, especially large-scale oratorios. Nobel Prize winner Romain Rolland wrote, \"It's not easy to give you an exact idea of how popular Lorenzo Perosi is in his native country.\" Perosi's fame was not restricted to Europe. A 19 March 1899 \"New York Times\" article entitled \"The Genius of Don Perosi\" began, \"The great and ever-increasing success which has greeted the four new oratorios of Don Lorenzo Perosi has placed this young priest-composer on a pedestal of fame which can only be compared with that which has been accorded of late years to the idolized Pietro Mascagni by his fellow-countrymen.\" Gianandrea Gavazzeni made the same comparison: \"The sudden clamors of applause, at the end of the [19th] century, were just like those a decade earlier for Mascagni.\" Perosi worked for five Popes, including Pope St. Pius X who greatly fostered his rise. Mala Pasqua! (Bad Easter!) is an opera in three acts composed by Stanislao Gastaldon to a libretto by Giovanni Domenico Bartocci-Fontana. The libretto is based on Giovanni Verga's play, \"Cavalleria rusticana\" (\"Rustic Chivalry\") which Verga had adapted from his short story of the same name. \"Mala Pasqua!\" premiered on 9 April 1890 at the Teatro Costanzi in Rome, six weeks before Pietro Mascagni's opera \"Cavalleria rusticana\" which was also based on Verga's play. Bartocci-Fontana's libretto adds some elements that were not in Verga's original and expands on others. The name of the Santuzza character was also changed to Carmela, but the basic plot and setting remain the same. Its title refers to the curse which Carmela places on Turiddu, the lover who had spurned her: \"Mala Pasqua a te!\" (\"May you have an evil Easter!\"). Following its Rome premiere \"Mala Pasqua!\" had a few more performances in Perugia and Lisbon, but it was completely eclipsed by the phenomenal success of Mascagni's opera. After the 1891 Lisbon run it was not heard again until 2010 when it was given a semi-staged performance in Agrigento, Sicily. Richard Georg Strauss (11 June 1864 \u2013 8 September 1949) was a leading German composer of the late Romantic and early modern eras. He is known for his operas, which include \"Der Rosenkavalier\", \"Elektra\", \"Die Frau ohne Schatten\" and \"Salome\"; his Lieder, especially his \"Four Last Songs\"; his tone poems, including \"Don Juan\", \"Death and Transfiguration\", \"Till Eulenspiegel's Merry Pranks\", \"Also sprach Zarathustra\", \"Ein Heldenleben\", \"Symphonia Domestica\", and \"An Alpine Symphony\"; and other instrumental works such as \"Metamorphosen\" and his Oboe Concerto. Strauss was also a prominent conductor in Western Europe and the Americas, enjoying quasi-celebrity status as his compositions became standards of orchestral and operatic repertoire. Mark Delavan is an American operatic bass-baritone. He made his professional debut in 1986 at the San Francisco Opera in a small role in Giuseppe Verdi's \"Don Carlos\". He spent the next three years performing in numerous comprimario roles with the company. He has since returned to that opera house to sing Scarpia in Giacomo Puccini's \"Tosca\" (2004, with Carol Vaness in the title role) and Wotan in Richard Wagner's \"The Ring Cycle\" (2008, 2010, and 2011). In 2001 he made his debut at the Metropolitan Opera as Amonasro in Verdi's \"Aida\" with Deborah Voigt in the title role, Luciano Pavarotti as Radam\u00e8s, Olga Borodina as Amneris, and James Levine conducting. He has since been heard at the Met as Alfio in Pietro Mascagni's \"Cavalleria rusticana\", Carlo G\u00e9rard in \"Andrea Ch\u00e9nier\", Count Tomsky in \"The Queen of Spades\", Don Carlo in Verdi's \"La Forza del Destino\", the Messenger in Richard Strauss' \"Die Frau ohne Schatten\", Scarpia, and the title roles in Verdi's \"Nabucco\", Verdi's \"Rigoletto\", and Verdi's \"Simon Boccanegra\". Pietro Antonio Stefano Mascagni (] ; 7 December 1863 \u2013 2 August 1945) was an Italian composer most noted for his operas. His 1890 masterpiece \"Cavalleria Rusticana\" caused one of the greatest sensations in opera history and single-handedly ushered in the \"Verismo\" movement in Italian dramatic music. While it was often held that Mascagni, like Leoncavallo, was a \"one-opera man\" who could never repeat his first success, \"L'amico Fritz\" and \"Iris\" have remained in the repertoire in Europe (especially Italy) since their premieres. Mascagni said that at one point, \"Iris\" was performed in Italy more often than \"Cavalleria\" (cf. Stivender). Valery Kritskov is a Russian conductor who used to take conducting lessons at the Moscow Institute of Culture which were taught by Kirill Tikhonov. He graduated from there in 1988 and then worked in Moscow-based Helikon Opera till he got employed with Novaya Opera in 2002. While there, he conducted many operas including Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov's \"The Snow Maiden\" and \"The Tsar\u2019s Bride\" as well as Anton Rubinstein's \"The Demon\" and Tchaikovsky's \"The Maid of Orleans\". He also conducted works by the Italian composers such as Pietro Mascagni's \"Cavalleria rusticana\" and Ruggero Leoncavallo's \"Pagliacci\" and German such as Richard Wagner's \"Lohengrin\" and Strauss' \"Die Fledermaus\" as well as a concert dedicated to Vincenzo Bellini. Besides operas, he is also known for his conducting of the Russian ballet based on works by Tchaikovsky and Sergei Prokofiev as well as German and Austrian ballet composers such as Ludwig Minkus and Charles Gounod. Later on, he became a conductor of the Copp\u00e9lia ballet which was based by L\u00e9o Delibes work and was produced by Imperial Russian Ballet. Currently he has two CD recordings called \"Chorus of the Novaya Opera Theatre of Moscow\" and the \"Soloists of the Novaya Opera Theatre of Moscow\". Rapsodia Satanica was a 1915 silent film directed by Nino Oxilia featuring Lyda Borelli in a female version of Faust based on poems by Fausto Maria Martini. Pietro Mascagni wrote his only film music for the film and conducted the first performance in July 1917. Mascagni was keen to take commission for the film music due to the financial burden of supporting two sickening brothers. The French-German TV channel Arte restored the film in 2006 and Deutsche Staatsphilharmonie Rheinland-Pfalz, conducted by Frank Strobel recorded Mascagni's score.\n\nQuestion:\nWho died first Richard Strauss or Pietro Mascagni?\n\nPlease give the answer directly without any explanation.", "results": "Richard Strauss died on 8 September 1949, and Pietro Mascagni died on 2 August 1945.", "reasoning_chains": []}

Its name derives from its predecessor \"Aqua Virgo\", which was constructed by Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa in 19 BC. Its terminal castellum is located at the Baths of Agrippa, and it served the vicinity of Campus Martius through its various conduits. In an effort to restore fresh water to Rome during the Renaissance, Pope Nicholas V, in 1453, renovated the main channels of the Aqua Virgo and added numerous secondary conduits under Campo Marzio. The original terminus, called a \"mostra\", which means \"showpiece\", was the stately, dignified wall fountain designed by Leon-Battista Alberti in Piazza dei Crociferi. Due to several additions and modifications to the end-most points of the conduits during the years that followed, during the Renaissance and Baroque periods, the Acqua Vergine culminated in several magnificent \"mostre\" - the Trevi Fountain and the fountains of Piazza del Popolo.

Because neither collection spanned Lennon's releases up to and including 1984's \"Milk and Honey\", \"Lennon Legend: The Very Best of John Lennon\" \u2013 considered the definitive Lennon retrospective \u2013 was compiled to rectify the situation. It was released in the UK in 1997 through Parlophone and early 1998 in the US by EMI Records. Anna-Lou \"Annie\" Leibovitz ( ; born October 2, 1949) is an American portrait photographer.

John Lennon was an English musician who gained worldwide fame as one of the members of the Beatles, for his subsequent solo career, and for his political activism and pacifism. On Monday, December 8, 1980, Lennon was shot dead by Mark David Chapman in the archway of the Dakota, his residence in New York City. Lennon had just returned from Record Plant Studio with his wife, Yoko Ono. Mark David Chapman (born May 10, 1955) is an American prison inmate who murdered John Lennon outside the Dakota apartment building in Manhattan in New York City on December 8, 1980. Chapman fired five times at Lennon, hitting him four times in the back. Chapman later remained at the crime scene and began reading J. D. Salinger's novel \"The Catcher in the Rye\" until the police arrived and arrested him. He repeatedly said that the novel was his statement. Chapter 27 is a 2007 biographical film depicting the murder of John Lennon by Mark David Chapman. It was written and directed by Jarrett Schaefer, based on the book \"Let Me Take You Down\" by Jack Jones, produced by Robert Salerno, and stars Jared Leto as Chapman. The film takes place in December 1980, and is intended to be an exploration of Chapman's psyche. \"Evening Wear\" and \"Mark David Chapman\" are songs by Mindless Self Indulgence, released as a double A-side single on January 19, 2009 in the UK and January 20, 2009 in North America. This single includes the video for \"Mark David Chapman\" in four different formats, directed by Mike Dahlquist, and the previously unreleased song, \"Written in Cold Blood\". \"Evening Wear/Mark David Chapman\" peaked at number 2 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 Singles Sales chart and number 1 on the Hot Dance Singles Sales chart. \"I Just Shot John Lennon\" is a song from The Cranberries' album \"To the Faithful Departed\".

It includes the hit singles \"My Sweet Lord\" and \"What Is Life\", as well as songs such as \"Isn't It a Pity\" and the title track that had been turned down for inclusion on releases by the Beatles. The album reflects the influence of Harrison's musical activities with artists such as Bob Dylan, the Band, Delaney & Bonnie and Billy Preston during 1968\u201370, and his growth as an artist beyond his supporting role to former bandmates John Lennon and Paul McCartney. \"All Things Must Pass\" introduced Harrison's signature sound, the slide guitar, and the spiritual themes that would be present throughout his subsequent solo work. The original vinyl release consisted of two LPs of songs and a third disc of informal jams, titled \"Apple Jam\".

Webb was born in Virginia in 1792 and spent part of his early years in Georgia and Florida. He taught school as a teenager, worked in the office of the county clerk and studied for the bar. He became an attorney in 1816. Burlingham is an unincorporated community in northern Bedford Township, Meigs County, Ohio, United States named for the area's first postmaster. Burlingham allegedly received the nickname of \"Bungtown\" in the late 1800 when the local women became upset with their husbands for spending too much time at the local saloon and knocked all of the bungs out of the whiskey barrels. The escaping liquor was then used to burn down the saloon. Bourbon whiskey is a type of American whiskey, a barrel-aged distilled spirit made primarily from corn. The name is derived from the French Bourbon dynasty, although it is unclear precisely what inspired the whiskey's name (contenders include Bourbon County in Kentucky and Bourbon Street in New Orleans). Bourbon has been distilled since the 18th century. The use of the term \"bourbon\" for the whiskey has been traced to the 1820s, and the term began to be used consistently in Kentucky in the 1870s. While bourbon may be made anywhere in the United States, it is strongly associated with the American South, and with Kentucky in particular. As of 2014, the distillers' wholesale market revenue for bourbon sold within the U.S. is about $2.7 billion, and bourbon makes up about two-thirds of the $1.6 billion of U.S. exports of distilled spirits. In 1927, during the height of Prohibition, Midwest gangster Al Capone decided that so much liquor was flowing into the United States across the Canada\u2013US border through Detroit that he decide he wanted in on the action. After some negotiations, he formed a partnership with the Purple Gang of Detroit. They took Canadian Club Whiskey, labeled it \"Old Log Cabin\" Whiskey. One of the people that Capone sold Old Log Cabin to was fellow Chicago bootlegger, Bugs Moran. Bugs Moran decided that he wasn't making enough money off his liquor sales and decided to re-buy Old Log Cabin from hijackers at half the price. Moran's crew started hijacking the Purple Gang supply trucks heading into Detroit. In May 1792, American merchant sea captain Robert Gray sailed into the Columbia River, becoming the first recorded European to navigate into it. The voyage, conducted on the \"Columbia Rediviva\", a privately owned ship, was eventually used as a basis for the United States' claim on the Pacific Northwest, although its relevance to the claim was disputed by the British. As a result of the outcome the river was afterwards named after the ship. Gray spent nine days on the river trading fur pelts before sailing out of the river. \"Soldier's Joy\" is a fiddle tune, classified as a reel or country dance. It is popular in the American fiddle canon, in which it is touted as \"an American classic\" but traces its origin to Scottish fiddling traditions, and Irish fiddle traditions. It has been played in Scotland for over 200 years, and Robert Burns used it for the first song of his cantata 'The Jolly Beggars'. According to documentation at the United States Library of Congress, it is \"one of the oldest and most widely distributed tunes\" and is rated in the top ten most-played Old Time Fiddle tune. According to the Illinois Humanities Center, the tune dates as early as the 1760s. In spite of its upbeat tempo and catchy melody, the term \"soldier's joy\" has a much darker meaning than is portrayed by the tune. This term eventually came to refer to the combination of whiskey, beer, and morphine used by Civil War soldiers. Government procurement in the United States is the process by which the Federal Government of the United States acquires goods, services (notably construction), and interests in real property.
