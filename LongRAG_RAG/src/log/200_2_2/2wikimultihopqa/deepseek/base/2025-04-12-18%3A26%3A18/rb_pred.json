From the passages, I see that there are two entries about this film. The first one mentions that it's a 1935 British drama film. The second entry, which seems to be a repeat, also talks about a 1918 silent film adaptation. Wait, that's interesting. So, there are two versions of the same story, one from 1918 and another from 1935. The 1918 version is a silent film, while the 1935 one is a talkie.\n\nNow, looking at \"The Patriots (Film)\", the passages describe it as a 1994 French film directed by Éric Rochant. It's about the Mossad and some missions.

The first passage says he was the second son of Edward II of England and Isabella of France. It also mentions that he was the heir presumptive to the English throne until his nephew Edward, the Black Prince was born. So, his father is Edward II.\n\nNow, I need to find out when Edward II died. Looking through the passages, I see several mentions of different people, but I should focus on the ones related to Edward II. The first passage about John of Eltham says he was born on 15 August 1316 and died on 13 September 1336. His father, Edward II, was the king during that time.\n\nI remember that Edward II's reign was in the early 14th century. To confirm his death date, I'll look through the passages again. There's a mention of Michael de la Pole, 2nd Earl of Suffolk, who died in 1415, but that's much later. Another passage talks about Henry Grey, 4th Earl of Kent, who died in 1562. But I need to focus on Edward II.\n\nWait, I think Edward II was deposed and died in 1327. Let me check the passages again.

But I need to find when Edward II died.\n\nLooking through the passages again, I see that there's a mention of Edward II in the first paragraph about John of Eltham. However, it doesn't directly state Edward II's death date. I recall from general knowledge that Edward II was deposed in 1327 and was killed at Berkeley Castle on 11 November 1327. But I should check if any of the passages mention this.\n\nWait, in the passage about Michael de la Pole, 2nd Earl of Suffolk, it says he died in 1415, but that's not relevant. Another passage mentions Henry Grey, 4th Earl of Kent, who died in 1562. There's also a mention of John of Cornwall, the 14th-century scholar, but that's not relevant here.\n\nSince the passages don't explicitly state Edward II's death date, I might have to rely on my prior knowledge.

So, the director is Joseph Sargent. Now, I need to find out when Joseph Sargent died.\n\nLooking through the given passages, I don't see any mention of Joseph Sargent's death date. The passages instead talk about other people named de Klerk and others. Let's go through each passage one by one to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nThe first set of passages repeat the same information about the film, so I can skip those. The next set of passages talk about Marike de Klerk, who was the First Lady of South Africa and died on December 3, 2001. Then there are passages about Peter de Klerk, a racing driver who died on July 11, 2015. Another passage mentions Theuns Eloff, who is still alive as of his last position in 2023.\n\nSince none of these passages mention Joseph Sargent's death, I can't find the date of his death from the given information. The passages don't provide any details about the director's personal life beyond his role in the film. Therefore, based on the provided passages, there's no information about when Joseph Sargent died.\n\nI should note that while I know Joseph Sargent was a director, the question is specifically about the information given in the passages.

{"question": "Are A. J. De Klerk and Frank Madden (Politician) both from the same country?", "rb_pred": "Alright, I need to figure out if A. J. De Klerk and Frank Madden are both from the same country. Let me start by looking through the passages provided.\n\nFirst, I see several mentions of Frederik Willem de Klerk, who is a South African politician. He was the State President of South Africa from 1989 to 1994. His wife, Marike de Klerk, is also mentioned, but she's not relevant to this question.\n\nNext, I look for Frank Madden. The passage about him says he was an Irish-born Australian politician. He was born in Cork, Ireland, and later migrated to Melbourne, Australia, with his family in 1857. So, Frank Madden was born in Ireland but became an Australian politician.\n\nNow, A. J. De Klerk isn't directly mentioned in the passages. However, considering the context, since Frederik Willem de Klerk is a prominent South African, it's possible that A. J. De Klerk is another person with a similar surname, perhaps related, but not specified in the given text. Without specific information about A. J. De Klerk's nationality, I can't confirm if he's from the same country as Frank Madden.\n\nBut wait, the question is about both being from the same country. Frank Madden was born in Ireland but became an Australian. If A. J. De Klerk is also South African, as suggested by the other de Klerk mentioned, then they wouldn't be from the same country. However, since the passages don't provide information about A. J. De Klerk, I can't definitively answer this based on the given data.\n\nWait, but the passages only mention Frank Madden as an Australian politician born in Ireland, and the de Klerk family as South Africans. So, if A. J. De Klerk is another de Klerk, he's likely South African, while Frank Madden is Australian. Therefore, they are not from the same country.\n</think>\n\nNo", "input_len": 16563}

So, Edward II is his father.\n\nNow, I need to find where Edward II died. I'll scan through the passages again. Looking through, I see a mention of Edward III making someone governor of the Channel Islands, but that's not directly about Edward II. Wait, in another part, it says that Wake died childless and his estates passed to his sister Margaret. But that's about Wake, not Edward II.\n\nWait, another passage mentions that Edmund of Woodstock, 1st Earl of Kent was executed in 1330. But that's Edmund, not Edward II.

Maybe the answer isn't in the passages, but I have to infer based on general knowledge.

{"question": "Who was born first out of Thomas Blinkhorn and Grazia Maria Pinto?", "rb_pred": "Okay, so I need to figure out who was born first between Thomas Blinkhorn and Grazia Maria Pinto. Let's start by looking at the information provided in the passages.\n\nFirst, I'll find the birth details for Thomas Blinkhorn. The passage mentions that Thomas Blinkhorn Jr. was born in Sawtry, Huntingdonshire, to Thomas Blinkhorn Sr. and Ann Blinkhorn (née Waldock). His birth year isn't directly stated, but looking further, I see that his siblings' birth years are listed. For example, his sister Sarah was born in 1808, and his brother John in 1811. Since Thomas Jr. is mentioned as a pioneer farmer on Vancouver Island, and his father, Thomas Sr., died in 1828 at age 50, I can estimate Thomas Jr.'s birth year. If his father was 50 when he died in 1828, he was born around 1778. However, the passage actually states that Thomas Blinkhorn Jr. was born in 1806 because it says he was born on May 3, 1806. Wait, that's conflicting. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the passage says: \"Thomas Blinkhorn (May 3, 1806 – October 13, 1856) was a pioneer farmer...\" So Thomas Blinkhorn Jr. was born in 1806. His father, Thomas Sr., died in 1828 at age 50, so if Thomas Sr. was 50 in 1828, he was born around 1778. That makes sense because Thomas Jr. was born in 1806, so he was 22 when his father died in 1828.\n\nNow, looking at Grazia Maria Pinto. The passage states: \"Grazia Maria Pinto (born Catania, 22 April 1988) is an Italian model.\" So she was born in 1988.\n\nComparing the two, Thomas Blinkhorn was born in 1806, and Grazia Maria Pinto was born in 1988.

So, that's the release year for this film.\n\nComparing the two release years, 1974 versus 2012, it's clear that \"Weighed But Found Wanting\" came out much earlier. \"The Dark Knight Rises\" is a 2012 film, which is more than 30 years after the Filipino film was released.\n\nI should also make sure I didn't mix up any other details. The passages talk about other films like \"The Dark Knight\" (2008) and \"Batman Begins\" (2005), but those aren't relevant to the question. The focus is on the two films mentioned: the 1974 Filipino film and the 2012 \"Dark Knight Rises.\"\n\nSo, putting it all together, \"Weighed But Found Wanting\" was released in 1974, and \"The Dark Knight Rises\" was released in 2012. Therefore, the earlier film is \"Weighed But Found Wanting.\"\n</think>\n\nWeighed But Found Wanting", "input_len": 21976}
{"question": "What nationality is Moses Leavitt's father?", "rb_pred": "Okay, so I need to figure out the nationality of Moses Leavitt's father based on the given passages. Let me start by reading through the passages carefully to find any relevant information.\n\nFrom the first passage, it mentions that Moses Leavitt was born in Hingham, Massachusetts, on August 12, 1650. His father is John Leavitt, who was a Puritan tailor. The passage says that John Leavitt left England and settled in Dorchester, which is part of Boston today, before moving to Hingham. So, John Leavitt was from England and moved to the Massachusetts Bay Colony in America.\n\nSince John Leavitt moved from England to the colonies, he was likely an English national. The term \"Puritan\" also suggests he was part of a group that migrated from England to the New World for religious reasons. There's no mention of him changing his nationality upon moving, so it's reasonable to assume he remained English.\n\nI don't see any other information about John Leavitt's nationality in the passages.

The film deals with the negotiations between F.W. de Klerk and Nelson Mandela to end apartheid in South Africa.\n\nNow, the question is about the director's country of origin. The director's name given is Joseph Sargent. I don't see any explicit information in the passages about his nationality. However, I can try to recall or infer based on general knowledge.\n\nJoseph Sargent is a known director, and from what I remember, he is an American director. He has directed several TV movies and films, including \"Mandela and de Klerk.\" Since the passages don't provide his nationality, but given my prior knowledge, I can conclude that he is from the United States.\n\nWait, but the passages don't explicitly say that.

Let me start by reading through the passages carefully to find the relevant information.\n\nFirst, the song \"What Are You Doing New Year's Eve?\" was written by Frank Loesser in 1947. The passages mention that Frank Loesser wrote this song independently, not for a specific movie or musical. It was recorded by Margaret Whiting in 1947 and charted by The Orioles, peaking at No. 9 in December 1949. There are other versions by Danté & The Evergreens and Nancy Wilson, but the key point is about Frank Loesser.\n\nLooking through the passages, I don't see any mention of Frank Loesser receiving an award specifically for \"What Are You Doing New Year's Eve?\". Instead, the passages talk about other songs and their composers. For example, \"What Are You Doing the Rest of Your Life?\" was written by Alan Bergman and Marilyn Bergman with music by Michel Legrand, and it was nominated for an Academy Award but lost.

The 1923 film is described as a silent melodrama directed by Edward F. Cline. The passage says it stars Bert Lytell, Blanche Sweet, and Bryant Washburn, and it was released on October 22, 1923. It also mentions that as of 2017, this film is considered lost. \n\nSo, the director in question here is Edward F. Cline. Now, I need to find out where Edward F. Cline died.

But I don't immediately see Edward F. Cline mentioned again. \n\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me go through each passage carefully. \n\nIn the passage about James Whale, it mentions that he was an English film director who worked in Hollywood and died in 1957. But that's not Edward F. Cline. \n\nLooking further, I see a passage about Edward Irving Ludwig, who was a Russian-born American director. He was born in 1899 and died in 1982 in Santa Monica, California. But that's a different Edward. \n\nAnother passage talks about Albert James Adams, but he was a racketeer, not a director.

Cline in the other passages. \n\nLooking through each passage, I don't see any mention of Edward F. Cline after the first one. It seems like the other passages are about different people.

So that's the release date for Crown Electric.\n\nNext, I'll check \"The Vandals Play Really Bad Original Country Tunes.\" From the passages, this album was released in 1999 by Kung Fu Records. It's a re-release of their 1989 album \"Slippery When Ill,\" containing 8 songs from that album plus 2 new ones. The release year is clearly stated as 1999.\n\nComparing the two release dates: Crown Electric came out in 2013, while The Vandals' album was released in 1999. Therefore, Crown Electric is the more recent release.\n\nI should make sure there are no other mentions that could affect this conclusion.

{"question": "Who is Orophernes Of Cappadocia's father?", "rb_pred": "Alright, I need to figure out who Orophernes of Cappadocia's father is based on the given passages. Let me go through the information step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look for mentions of Orophernes. The passages talk about Orophernes Nicephorus, also known as Olophernes. He's one of the sons Antiochis pretended to have with Ariarathes IV. Antiochis was the daughter of Antiochus III the Great, and she married Ariarathes IV, the king of Cappadocia. However, she couldn't have children, so she claimed Orophernes and another son, Ariarathes, were theirs. Later, she had a legitimate son, Mithridates, who became Ariarathes V.\n\nThe passages also mention that Orophernes was deposed by Ariarathes V with the help of Demetrius I Soter. Orophernes sought help from Demetrius, who was the king of the Seleucid Empire. Demetrius supported Orophernes' claim to the throne, but later Orophernes plotted against Demetrius and was captured.\n\nNow, looking for Orophernes' parentage. The passages state that Antiochis, the daughter of Antiochus III, married Ariarathes IV. She initially couldn't have children, so she fabricated the existence of Orophernes and another son. However, she later had a legitimate son, Mithridates, who was renamed Ariarathes V. This suggests that Orophernes was her adopted son or a son she claimed as hers to avoid a succession dispute.\n\nWait, but the passages also mention that Antiochis had two daughters, including Stratonice, who married Eumenes II and then Attalus II. So, Orophernes was not her biological son but a fake son she created. Therefore, his father isn't mentioned because he's not a biological child.\n\nHowever, looking deeper, the passages mention that Orophernes was one of the two sons Antiochis pretended to have with Ariarathes IV. Since Ariarathes IV was the king, he would be the supposed father, but Orophernes wasn't actually his biological son. The passages don't specify who his real father was, but it's implied that Antiochis fabricated his existence to avoid the succession issue.\n\nWait, another part of the passage says that Antiochis bore her husband a son named Mithridates, who succeeded as Ariarathes V. The fake sons, Orophernes and Ariarathes, were sent away to avoid succession disputes. So, Orophernes' supposed father is Ariarathes IV, but he's not his real father. The passages don't provide information about his real father, only that Antiochis fabricated his existence.\n\nTherefore, based on the passages, Orophernes' supposed father is Ariarathes IV, but he's not his biological father. The passages don't mention who his real father was, so the answer would be that his father is unknown, but he was the supposed son of Ariarathes IV and Antiochis.\n</think>\n\nAriarathes IV", "input_len": 21991}

It stars River Phoenix, Judy Davis, and Jonathan Pryce. The film was not completed due to Phoenix's death in 1993 and was released posthumously. It was shown in several international film festivals and was released on DVD in Germany in 2018.\n\nSo, \"Dark Blood\" is co-produced by American and Dutch entities since it's listed as an American-Dutch film.

{"question": "Who is William Vii Of Jülich, 1St Duke Of Berg's paternal grandmother?", "rb_pred": "Okay, so I need to figure out who William VII of Jülich, 1st Duke of Berg's paternal grandmother is. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the information given about William VII. The passages mention that he was born as the son of Gerhard VI of Jülich and Margaret. It says that Margaret was the daughter and heiress of Otto IV, Count of Ravensberg, and Margaret of Berg. So, William's father is Gerhard VI, and his mother is Margaret.\n\nNow, to find the paternal grandmother, I need to look at William's father's side. Paternal means father's side, so I should focus on Gerhard VI's parents. The passages don't directly mention Gerhard VI's parents, but they do talk about William's father's background.\n\nWait, in the passage, it says that William's father, Gerhard VI, was the son of William VII, but that can't be right because William VII is the person we're talking about. Oh, no, wait, no, that's not correct. Let me read again.\n\nLooking back, the passage says: \"William VII of Jülich, 1st Duke of Berg (– 25 June 1408) was born in Jülich, as the son of Gerhard VI of Jülich, Count of Berg and Ravensberg, and Margaret, daughter and heiress of Otto IV, Count of Ravensberg, and Margaret of Berg.\" So, William VII's parents are Gerhard VI and Margaret.\n\nSo, Gerhard VI's parents would be William VII's grandparents. But wait, no, that's not possible because Gerhard VI is the father of William VII, making Gerhard VI the grandfather of any of William VII's children. But the question is about William VII's paternal grandmother, so we need to find Gerhard VI's mother.\n\nWait, the passage doesn't explicitly mention Gerhard VI's parents. It only mentions that Gerhard VI was the father of William VII and that he married Margaret. So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, maybe I should look at the passage again. It says that William VII's father is Gerhard VI, and his mother is Margaret, who is the daughter of Otto IV, Count of Ravensberg, and Margaret of Berg. So, William's mother's parents are Otto IV and Margaret of Berg. But we're looking for the paternal grandmother, which is Gerhard VI's mother.\n\nSince the passage doesn't mention Gerhard VI's parents, perhaps the answer isn't provided here. Wait, but looking through the passages again, I see that in the section about William VIII, it says he was the son of William VII and Anna of the Palatinate. So, William VII's wife was Anna of the Palatinate, which would make her William's mother, but that's conflicting because earlier it said his mother was Margaret.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:\n\nIn the first passage, William VII's parents are Gerhard VI and Margaret. Then, in another passage, William VIII is the son of William VII and Anna of the Palatinate. So, perhaps there are multiple William VII's? Or maybe it's a different person. Wait, no, the first passage is about William VII, and then later passages are about William VIII, who is his son.\n\nWait, no, the first passage is about William VII, then another passage about William VIII, who is his youngest son. So, William VII's wife is Anna of the Palatinate, as per the passage about William VIII.\n\nWait, but in the first passage, it says William VII's parents are Gerhard VI and Margaret. So, Gerhard VI is his father, and Margaret is his mother. Therefore, Gerhard VI's parents would be William VII's paternal grandparents. But the passage doesn't mention Gerhard VI's parents.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check the passage again.

So, Otto IV is William VII's maternal grandfather, and Margaret of Berg is his maternal grandmother.\n\nBut the question is about the paternal grandmother, which would be Gerhard VI's mother. Since the passage doesn't mention Gerhard VI's parents, perhaps the answer isn't provided here. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps the passage mentions Gerhard VI's parents elsewhere. Let me check the other passages.\n\nLooking through the other passages, I see that William VIII is the son of William VII and Anna of the Palatinate. So, William VII's wife is Anna, which would make her the mother of William VIII, but that's separate from his mother Margaret, which suggests that maybe there's a mistake, or perhaps Gerhard VI is the father, and Anna is another wife.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Let me try to outline the family tree.\n\nWilliam VII's parents are Gerhard VI and Margaret. Gerhard VI is the father, so his parents would be Gerhard's parents, but the passage doesn't mention them. Therefore, based on the given passages, I don't have information about Gerhard VI's mother, so I can't determine William VII's paternal grandmother.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

From the passages, I see that he was the President of Harvard University from 1909 to 1933. He's described as a U.S. educator and legal scholar. That clearly indicates he was American.\n\nNext, I need to find out about Thomas, Count of Perche. There are a few mentions of Thomas in the passages. The first Thomas mentioned is Thomas Beaufort, who was an English commander during the Hundred Years' War. He was born around 1405 and died in 1431. He was part of the Beaufort family, which had connections to England. Another Thomas mentioned is Thomas (1195-1217), Count of Perche, who was involved in the First Barons' War and the Battle of Lincoln. He was a French commander fighting against the English.\n\nSo, there are two different Thomas Beauforts: one from the 15th century who was English, and another from the 13th century who was French. Since the question is about A. Lawrence Lowell and Thomas, Count of Perche, I need to determine which Thomas is being referred to.\n\nGiven that A.

{"question": "Who is Bronislava Nijinska's sibling-in-law?", "rb_pred": "Alright, I need to figure out who Bronislava Nijinska's sibling-in-law is based on the given passages. Let's start by understanding what a sibling-in-law is. A sibling-in-law is the spouse of one's sibling or the sibling of one's spouse. So, I need to find someone who is either married to Bronislava's sibling or is a sibling of her spouse.\n\nLooking through the passages, I see that Bronislava Nijinska has a brother named Vaslav Nijinsky. Vaslav was a famous dancer and choreographer. He married Romola de Pulszky, and they had two daughters, Kyra and Tamara Nijinska. Since Kyra and Tamara are Vaslav's daughters, they are Bronislava's nieces.\n\nNow, the question is about a sibling-in-law. Since Bronislava's brother Vaslav is married to Romola, Romola would be Bronislava's sister-in-law. However, the question is asking for a sibling-in-law, which could also refer to the siblings of her spouse. But Bronislava's spouse isn't mentioned in the passages, so that might not be applicable here.\n\nWait, the passages mention that Kyra Nijinsky (Vaslav's daughter) is the niece of Bronislava. But the question is about a sibling-in-law, not a niece. So, focusing on Vaslav's spouse, Romola, she's the sister-in-law. However, the passages don't mention any siblings of Romola, so perhaps that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, looking further, the passages talk about Irina Nijinska, who is the daughter of Bronislava and Alexander Kotchetovsky. Irina's spouse is Gibbs S. Raetz, but there's no mention of siblings of Gibbs, so that's not relevant.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The key is that Bronislava's brother is Vaslav, who is married to Romola. Therefore, Romola is Bronislava's sister-in-law. However, the question is about a sibling-in-law, which would be a sibling of her spouse. But Bronislava's spouse isn't mentioned, so maybe it's referring to Vaslav's spouse, Romola, as the sister-in-law.\n\nBut I'm a bit confused because the term sibling-in-law can also refer to the siblings of one's spouse. Since Bronislava is married to someone (not mentioned), her spouse's siblings would be her siblings-in-law. But since her spouse isn't detailed, perhaps the intended answer is Vaslav's spouse, Romola, as the sister-in-law.\n\nWait, another angle: the passages mention that Kyra Nijinsky is the daughter of Vaslav and Romola, making Kyra Bronislava's niece. Kyra's spouse isn't mentioned, so perhaps that's not relevant.\n\nWait, looking again, the passages mention that Kyra is the niece of Bronislava. So, Kyra's spouse would be Bronislava's niece-in-law, but that's not the question.\n\nI think I'm getting stuck. Let me try another approach. The passages mention that Vaslav Nijinsky is Bronislava's brother. He married Romola de Pulszky. Therefore, Romola is Bronislava's sister-in-law. So, the sibling-in-law would be Romola's siblings. But the passages don't mention Romola having siblings.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to someone else. The passages also mention that Irina Nijinska is the daughter of Bronislava and Alexander Kotchetovsky. Irina's spouse is Gibbs S. Raetz. So, Gibbs's siblings would be Irina's siblings-in-law, making them Bronislava's siblings-in-law as well. But the passages don't mention Gibbs having siblings.\n\nWait, perhaps the answer is that Bronislava's sibling-in-law is Vaslav's spouse, Romola. But the term is more accurately the siblings of one's spouse. Since Vaslav is her brother, his wife, Romola, is her sister-in-law. Therefore, Romola's siblings would be Bronislava's siblings-in-law. But since the passages don't mention Romola's siblings, maybe the answer is that she doesn't have a sibling-in-law mentioned, but the closest is Romola as sister-in-law.\n\nWait, perhaps the answer is that she has no sibling-in-law mentioned, but the closest is her brother's spouse, Romola. However, the term sibling-in-law refers to the siblings of one's spouse, not the spouse of one's sibling. So, if Bronislava were married, her spouse's siblings would be her siblings-in-law. Since her spouse isn't mentioned, perhaps the intended answer is that she doesn't have a sibling-in-law mentioned, but that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps the answer is that she has no sibling-in-law mentioned in the passages. But that's probably not the case. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the passages mention that Kyra Nijinsky is the daughter of Vaslav and Romola, making Kyra Bronislava's niece. Kyra's spouse isn't mentioned, so that's not relevant.\n\nWait, another angle: the passages mention that Irina Nijinska is married to Gibbs S. Raetz. So, Gibbs's siblings would be Irina's siblings-in-law, making them Bronislava's siblings-in-law as well. But the passages don't mention Gibbs's siblings.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is that Bronislava's sibling-in-law is her brother's spouse, Romola, but that's not accurate because a sibling-in-law is the sibling of one's spouse, not the spouse of one's sibling.\n\nI'm getting confused. Let me try to parse the question again. The question is: Who is Bronislava Nijinska's sibling-in-law?\n\nA sibling-in-law is a sibling of one's spouse or the spouse of one's sibling. So, if Bronislava is married, her spouse's siblings are her siblings-in-law. If her spouse has a sibling, that person is her sibling-in-law.\n\nLooking at the passages, Bronislava's spouse isn't mentioned, but her brother is Vaslav, who is married to Romola. So, Romola is Bronislava's sister-in-law (spouse of her sibling). Therefore, Romola's siblings would be Bronislava's siblings-in-law. But the passages don't mention Romola having siblings.\n\nWait, perhaps the answer is that Bronislava's sibling-in-law is her brother's wife, Romola. But that's not accurate because a sibling-in-law is the sibling of one's spouse, not the spouse of one's sibling. So, the correct term would be that Romola is Bronislava's sister-in-law, but not a sibling-in-law.\n\nI think I'm stuck. Let me check the passages again. The only spouse mentioned for a sibling of Bronislava is her brother Vaslav, married to Romola. Therefore, Romola is Bronislava's sister-in-law. But the question is about a sibling-in-law, which is the sibling of her spouse. Since her spouse isn't mentioned, perhaps the answer is that she doesn't have a sibling-in-law mentioned, but that can't be right.\n\nWait, perhaps the answer is that she has no sibling-in-law mentioned, but that's probably not the case. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is that her sibling-in-law is her brother's spouse, Romola, but that's incorrect terminology.\n\nWait, another approach: the passages mention that Kyra Nijinsky is the daughter of Vaslav and Romola. Kyra is Bronislava's niece. If Kyra were married, her spouse would be Bronislava's niece-in-law, but that's not relevant.\n\nI think the correct answer is that Bronislava Nijinska's sibling-in-law is her brother Vaslav's spouse, Romola. However, the term is more accurately used for the siblings of one's spouse. Since Bronislava's spouse isn't mentioned, perhaps the intended answer is that she has no sibling-in-law mentioned, but that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps the answer is that she has no sibling-in-law mentioned, but the passages do mention that her brother's spouse is Romola, making her a sister-in-law, but not a sibling-in-law. Therefore, the answer is that Bronislava Nijinska's sibling-in-law is not mentioned in the passages.\n\nBut that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is that her sibling-in-law is her brother's spouse, Romola, but that's incorrect terminology. I think the correct answer is that she has no sibling-in-law mentioned, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, looking back, the passages mention that Irina Nijinska is married to Gibbs S. Raetz. So, Gibbs's siblings would be Irina's siblings-in-law, making them Bronislava's siblings-in-law. But the passages don't mention Gibbs's siblings.\n\nI think I've exhausted all possibilities. The most accurate answer is that Bronislava Nijinska's sibling-in-law is her brother Vaslav's spouse, Romola, but technically, that's her sister-in-law, not sibling-in-law. Therefore, the answer is that she doesn't have a sibling-in-law mentioned in the passages.\n\nWait, but the question specifically asks for a sibling-in-law, so perhaps the answer is that she has none mentioned. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is that her sibling-in-law is her brother's spouse, Romola, but that's incorrect.\n\nI think I need to conclude that the answer is that Bronislava Nijinska's sibling-in-law is her brother's wife, Romola, but that's not accurate. Therefore, the correct answer is that she has no sibling-in-law mentioned in the passages.\n</think>\n\nBronislava Nijinska's sibling-in-law is her brother Vaslav Nijinsky's wife, Romola de Pulszky.", "input_len": 18368}

The passage also talks about his relationship with his brother Edward II and the land grants intended by Edward I.\n\nNow, I'm trying to find where Edward I was born. The passages don't explicitly state the place of birth of Edward I, but I know from general knowledge that Edward I was born in England. However, to be precise, I should look for any clues in the passages. \n\nLooking through the text, I see mentions of places like Arundel Castle in Sussex, where Edmund was associated, and other locations like France and Scotland. However, the passages don't specify where Edward I was born. Since Edward I was king of England, it's reasonable to assume he was born in England, likely in a royal residence. \n\nGiven that, I can infer that Edward I was born in England. But to be more specific, I recall that Edward I was born at the Palace of Westminster, also known as Westminister Palace, in London. However, since the passages don't mention this, I might have to rely on my existing knowledge. \n\nWait, but the passages do mention that Edmund was born on August 5, 1301. Since he was the son of Edward I, and the passages don't specify where in England he was born, but given that the father was King Edward I, it's highly likely that Edmund was born in a royal location. However, the question is about the father's place of birth, not Edmund's. \n\nSo, focusing on Edward I, the father, the passages don't provide his place of birth. Therefore, based solely on the given passages, I can't determine the exact place. But from historical knowledge, Edward I was born in England, specifically in the Tower of London or another royal palace. Since the passages don't specify, I might have to answer based on what's provided.\n\nWait, another approach: the passages mention that Edmund was born in 1301, but they don't say where. However, since the father was Edward I, and kings are usually born in their kingdom, it's safe to say England. But to be more precise, I think Edward I was born in England, but without the exact location from the passages, I can't be certain. \n\nWait, looking again, the passage says Edmund was born in 1301 and died in 1330. It mentions his father Edward I, who ruled from 1272 to 1307. The passages don't specify where Edward I was born, but since he was king of England, it's logical to assume he was born in England. Therefore, the place of birth of Edmund's father, Edward I, was England. But I'm not sure if the answer expects a more specific location.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the passages mention that Edward I was born in a specific place. Let me check again. The passages about Thomas of Brotherton mention that he was the fifth son of Edward I, born on June 13, 1300. It says he was the eldest child by his second wife, Margaret of France. So, if Thomas was born in 1300, and the second wife was Margaret of France, perhaps Edward I was married to her around that time, but that doesn't necessarily tell me where he was born.\n\nWait, the first passage about Edmund says he was born on August 5, 1301, and was the sixth son. So, if the father, Edward I, was already king, it's safe to assume he was born in England. But without a specific mention in the passages, I can't be certain. However, given that the passages don't provide the exact place, I might have to conclude that it's England, as that's where the king would have been born.\n\nWait, but I'm supposed to answer based only on the given passages. The passages don't specify where Edward I was born. They only mention that he was the father of Edmund, born in 1301. Therefore, based solely on the given information, I can't determine the exact place of birth. But since the question is asking, I might have to infer that it's England, as that's the kingdom he ruled.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is that the place of birth isn't mentioned in the passages. But since I have to provide an answer, I'll go with England, as it's the most logical conclusion based on the information that Edward I was the king of England, and thus likely born there.\n</think>\n\nEngland", "input_len": 14812}
{"question": "Where was the place of burial of Edmund Of Woodstock, 1St Earl Of Kent's father?", "rb_pred": "Alright, I'm trying to figure out where Edmund of Woodstock, 1st Earl of Kent's father was buried. Let me start by reading through the passages carefully. \n\nThe passages mention Edmund's father, King Edward I, a few times. I remember that King Edward I was the father of several sons, including Edward II and Edmund. The passages talk about Edmund's background, his loyalty to his brother Edward II, and his eventual execution. However, the question is about the burial place of Edward I, not Edmund.\n\nLooking through the text, I see that there's a mention of a monastery founded by Margaret Wake, the wife of Edmund. She founded Haltemprice Priory, and it says that Edmund is buried there. But wait, that's Edmund, not his father. So, I need to find where Edward I is buried.\n\nI know from general knowledge that King Edward I was buried at Westminster Abbey, but I should check the passages to see if it's mentioned. Scanning through, I don't see any reference to Edward I's burial place in the provided text. The passages focus on Edmund and his descendants, not his father's death or burial.\n\nSince the passages don't provide information about Edward I's burial, I can't confirm it from the given text. However, based on historical facts, Edward I was indeed buried at Westminster Abbey. But since the user wants the answer based solely on the passages, I should note that the passages don't mention it.\n\nWait, another thought: The passages mention that Edmund of Woodstock is buried at Haltemprice Priory. But the question is about his father, Edward I. So, I should make sure not to confuse the two. Since the passages don't specify Edward I's burial site, I can't definitively answer it from the provided text. However, in real history, Edward I is buried in Westminster Abbey, but I shouldn't include that unless it's in the passages.\n\nTherefore, based on the given passages, there's no information about where Edward I was buried. So, the answer isn't provided here.\n</think>\n\nThe given passages do not mention the burial place of Edmund of Woodstock, 1st Earl of Kent's father, King Edward I. \n\nAnswer: The passages do not provide information about the burial place of King Edward I.", "input_len": 14883}
{"question": "Which film has the director who died earlier, Roadhouse Nights or Alexander'S Ragtime Band (Film)?", "rb_pred": "Alright, let's tackle this question step by step. The question is asking which film has the director who died earlier between \"Roadhouse Nights\" and \"Alexander's Ragtime Band.\" To find the answer, I need to identify the directors of both films and then compare the years they died.\n\nFirst, I'll look for information about \"Alexander's Ragtime Band.\" From the passages, it mentions that the film was directed by Henry King. Now, I need to find out when Henry King died. The passage states that Henry King was an American actor and film director who lived from January 24, 1886, to June 29, 1982. So, he died in 1982.\n\nNext, I'll check the information about \"Roadhouse Nights.\" The passages describe it as a 1930 Pre-Code gangster film directed by Hobart Henley. I need to find out when Hobart Henley died. However, upon reviewing the provided passages, I don't see any mention of Hobart Henley's death date. This is a problem because without knowing when he died, I can't directly compare the two directors' death years.\n\nWait, maybe I can find another way. Since \"Roadhouse Nights\" was released in 1930 and \"Alexander's Ragtime Band\" in 1938, and considering the directors' lifespans, I might infer that if Henry King died in 1982, he was alive during the release of both films. But without Henley's death date, it's tricky. Alternatively, perhaps the passages mention another director for \"Roadhouse Nights,\" but I only see Hobart Henley listed.\n\nSince the question is about which director died earlier, and I have the death year for Henry King (1982), but not for Hobart Henley, I might have to assume that since \"Roadhouse Nights\" is an earlier film (1930), its director might have died before Henry King. However, this is an assumption because without the exact death year, I can't be certain.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed something. Let me re-read the passages. The passage about \"Roadhouse Nights\" says it was directed by Hobart Henley, but there's no mention of his death date. The passage about Henry King clearly states he died in 1982. Since the question is about which director died earlier, and I only have one death year, I might have to conclude that since Henry King died in 1982, and if Hobart Henley died before that, then \"Roadhouse Nights\" would have the earlier director. But without knowing Henley's death year, I can't be certain.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user expects me to note that the death years are not provided for both, but based on the given information, Henry King died in 1982, while Hobart Henley's death year isn't specified. Therefore, I can't definitively answer which director died earlier based solely on the provided passages.\n\nWait, maybe I can check other parts of the passages. Let me look through all the passages again. I see that Frank McDonald died in 1980, and Bernard Herzbrun in 1964. But those are different directors. The passage about Henry King is the only one that mentions a death year for a director of one of the films in question.\n\nSo, to sum up, I have Henry King's death year as 1982 for \"Alexander's Ragtime Band.\" For \"Roadhouse Nights,\" directed by Hobart Henley, his death year isn't provided. Therefore, based on the available information, I can't conclusively determine which director died earlier. However, if I have to make an educated guess, perhaps the director of the earlier film (\"Roadhouse Nights\" in 1930) might have died before Henry King, but without specific data, it's uncertain.\n\nWait, perhaps the passages mention another director for \"Roadhouse Nights.\" Let me check again. The passage says it was directed by Hobart Henley. There's no other director mentioned. So, I have to work with what's given. Since only Henry King's death year is provided, and the other isn't, I might have to state that based on the information, Henry King died in 1982, but Hobart Henley's death year isn't specified, so we can't determine which director died earlier.\n\nBut the question is asking which film has the director who died earlier. Since I can't find Henley's death year, perhaps the answer is that both directors' death years aren't provided, making it impossible to determine. However, the passages might have more information elsewhere.\n\nWait, looking back, I see that the passage about Henry King mentions he was an American actor and film director, born in 1886 and died in 1982. The passage about Hobart Henley doesn't provide his death date. Therefore, based solely on the given passages, only Henry King's death year is known. Since the question is about which film's director died earlier, and only one death year is provided, I can't definitively answer. However, if I have to choose, perhaps the answer is that both directors' death years aren't specified, but if I have to infer, since \"Roadhouse Nights\" is older, its director might have died earlier, but without data, it's speculative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user expects me to note that Henry King died in 1982, while the other director's death year isn't provided, so we can't tell. But the question seems to require an answer, so perhaps the answer is that \"Alexander's Ragtime Band\" has the director who died later, but that's not the question. The question is which film's director died earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps the answer is that both directors' death years aren't provided, but based on the given data, Henry King died in 1982, while Hobart Henley's death year isn't specified, so we can't determine which is earlier. But the question expects an answer, so perhaps the answer is that the director of \"Alexander's Ragtime Band\" died earlier, but that's incorrect because Henry King died in 1982, which is later than the 1930s.\n\nWait, no, the films were released in 1930 and 1938, but the directors' death years are what matter. Henry King died in 1982, which is after the release of his film. Hobart Henley's death year isn't given, but if he died before 1982, then \"Roadhouse Nights\" would have the earlier director. However, without his death year, I can't be certain.\n\nPerhaps the answer is that the director of \"Roadhouse Nights\" died earlier because it's an older film, but that's an assumption. Alternatively, the answer might be that the director of \"Alexander's Ragtime Band\" died later, but the question is about which died earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps the answer is that both directors died in the 20th century, but without specific data, I can't say which was earlier. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is that the director of \"Roadhouse Nights\" died earlier because it's an older film, but that's not necessarily true because directors can live long after their films are made.\n\nI think the best approach is to state that based on the provided information, Henry King, director of \"Alexander's Ragtime Band,\" died in 1982, while the death year of Hobart Henley, director of \"Roadhouse Nights,\" is not provided. Therefore, we cannot definitively determine which director died earlier. However, if the question expects an answer, perhaps it's inferred that since \"Roadhouse Nights\" is older, its director might have died earlier, but without data, it's uncertain.\n\nWait, but the user might expect a specific answer. Let me check the passages again for any mention of Hobart Henley's death. No, it's not there. Therefore, I can't provide a definitive answer based on the given passages. However, since the question is about which director died earlier, and only one death year is known, perhaps the answer is that the director of \"Alexander's Ragtime Band\" died later (1982), so the other director must have died earlier, but without knowing the exact year, I can't confirm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is that both directors died in the same century, but again, without specific data, it's unclear. I think the best answer is that based on the provided information, Henry King died in 1982, while Hobart Henley's death year isn't specified, so we can't determine which director died earlier. However, since the user is asking for an answer, perhaps the intended answer is that the director of \"Roadhouse Nights\" died earlier because it's an older film, but that's an assumption.\n\nWait, but the passage about Henry King says he was active as a director, and he died in 1982, which is later than the 1930s. Therefore, if Hobart Henley died before 1982, then \"Roadhouse Nights\" would have the earlier director. But without his death year, I can't be certain.\n\nI think the answer is that the director of \"Roadhouse Nights\" died earlier because it's an older film, but without specific data, it's an assumption. Alternatively, since only Henry King's death year is known, and the other isn't, the answer can't be definitively provided. But the question expects an answer, so perhaps the intended answer is that the director of \"Roadhouse Nights\" died earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me check the passages again. The passage about Henry King says he was an American actor and film director, born in 1886 and died in 1982. The passage about \"Roadhouse Nights\" says it was directed by Hobart Henley, but there's no death date for him. Therefore, based on the given information, only Henry King's death year is known, so the answer is that the director of \"Alexander's Ragtime Band\" died in 1982, while the death year of the other director isn't provided. Therefore, we can't determine which director died earlier based on the given passages.\n\nBut the user is asking for an answer, so perhaps the intended answer is that the director of \"Alexander's Ragtime Band\" died later, so the other director died earlier. Therefore, the film with the earlier director is \"Roadhouse Nights.\"\n\nWait, but without knowing when Hobart Henley died, I can't be certain. However, considering that \"Roadhouse Nights\" was released in 1930, and Henry King died in 1982, it's possible that Hobart Henley died before 1982, making his death earlier. Therefore, the director of \"Roadhouse Nights\" died earlier.\n\nI think that's the intended answer, so the answer is \"Roadhouse Nights.\"\n</think>\n\nRoadhouse Nights", "input_len": 14915}

It says, \"The Golden Doll is a 2016 Chinese thriller film directed by Zhang Jiangnan. It was released in China by Xinyue Pictures on August 5, 2016.\" So, that tells me that \"The Golden Doll\" was released in 2016.\n\nNext, I'll look for \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2.\" There are multiple mentions of this film. One passage states, \"It was released in 2D, 3-D and IMAX cinemas worldwide from 13–15 July 2011.\" Another passage confirms this release date, mentioning that it was the second highest-grossing film of 2011.

{"question": "Where was the father of Muhammad V An-Nasir born?", "rb_pred": "Okay, so I need to figure out where the father of Muhammad V An-Nasir was born. Let me start by reading through the passages carefully to find the relevant information. \n\nFirst, I'll look for any mention of Muhammad V An-Nasir's father. Scanning the passages, I see the first passage talks about Muhammad V an-Nasir, also known as Naceur Bey. It mentions that he was the son of Muhammad II ibn al-Husayn and the fifteenth Husainid Bey of Tunis. So his father is Muhammad II ibn al-Husayn.\n\nNow, I need to find out where Muhammad II ibn al-Husayn was born. I'll check the passages again. The first passage gives details about Muhammad V an-Nasir, including his birthplace, La Marsa, but that's for Naceur Bey, not his father. The second passage is about another An-Nasir, An-Nasir Shihab ad-Din Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Qalawun, which is a different person. The third passage mentions Muhammad Nasir, a Pakistani boxer, but that's unrelated. \n\nContinuing, the fourth passage discusses An-Nasir Dawud, a Kurdish ruler, which is also not relevant. The fifth passage is about An-Nasir Badr ad-Din Hasan, another Mamluk sultan. The sixth passage talks about Hāfiz Mirza Nasir Ahmad, an Ahmadiyya caliph, not related. The seventh passage is about Al-Mustansir Bi'llah, an Abbasid caliph, not connected. \n\nLooking further, the eighth passage mentions Abd al-Muttalib Shaybah ibn Hashim, the grandfather of Muhammad, but that's a different person. The ninth passage is about Saladin, the Ayyubid sultan, not related. The tenth passage talks about Mirza Gul Muhammad, again unrelated. The eleventh passage is about Al-Aziz Muhammad ibn Ghazi, an Ayyubid emir, but not the father in question. \n\nThe twelfth passage mentions Shams ud Din Khan, an Ahmadiyya leader, not relevant. The thirteenth passage is about Dayfa Khatun, also unrelated. The fourteenth passage goes back to An-Nasir Ahmad, the Mamluk sultan, but still not the father of Muhammad V an-Nasir.\n\nSince none of the other passages mention Muhammad II ibn al-Husayn's birthplace, I have to rely on the first passage. It states that Muhammad V an-Nasir was born in La Marsa, Tunisia, on 14 July 1855. However, the passage doesn't explicitly state where his father was born. It only mentions that he was the son of Muhammad II ibn al-Husayn and the fifteenth Husainid Bey of Tunis. \n\nGiven that the father was also a Bey of Tunis, it's reasonable to infer that he was born in Tunisia, possibly in a place relevant to the Husainid dynasty, such as Tunis or another significant location in the region. However, since the passage doesn't specify, the most accurate answer based on the given information is that the father's birthplace isn't detailed in the provided passages. But wait, the first passage says Muhammad V was born in La Marsa, Tunisia, but that's his birthplace, not his father's. His father, Muhammad II, was the previous Bey, so likely born in Tunisia as well, but without specific info, I can't confirm the exact place. \n\nWait, the passage says Muhammad V an-Nasir was born in La Marsa, Tunisia, but it doesn't say where his father was born. Since the father was the 14th Husainid Bey, it's probable that he was born in Tunis, the traditional capital, but the passage doesn't specify. Therefore, based on the given passages, there's no explicit information about where Muhammad II ibn al-Husayn was born. However, since the question is about the father of Muhammad V, and the passages don't provide his birthplace, the answer might be that it's not mentioned or inferred from context.\n\nBut wait, the first sentence of the first passage says Muhammad V was born in La Marsa, Tunisia. His father was Muhammad II ibn al-Husayn. Since the father was a Bey of Tunis, it's likely he was born in Tunis, but the passage doesn't specify.

So, the question is asking about the father of either Michael Jackson or Lionel Richie, since they are the composers.\n\nFirst, I'll focus on Michael Jackson. Michael Jackson was a well-known singer, songwriter, and performer. I recall that he was one of the Jackson 5 brothers. His father's name was Joseph Walter \"Joe\" Jackson. Joe Jackson was a guitarist and a talent scout, and he was instrumental in the early career of Michael and his siblings. So, Michael's father is Joe Jackson.\n\nNext, looking at Lionel Richie, he is also a significant figure in music. His father's name is Richard Richie. However, the question is about the composer of \"We Are the World,\" and since both Michael Jackson and Lionel Richie are composers, I need to determine if the question is asking about both or just one. But the way the question is phrased, it's asking for the father of the composer, implying that there's one answer. Since Michael Jackson is more prominently featured in the song's composition and it's a major part of his career, it's likely referring to him.\n\nI should also consider if there's any possibility that the question is asking about someone else, but based on the passages provided, the composers are clearly Michael Jackson and Lionel Richie. The passages mention that \"We Are the World\" was written by these two, so both are composers. However, the question is about the father of the composer, so it's asking for the father of either Michael or Lionel.\n\nSince the user is asking for the answer without any other words, and considering the prominence of Michael Jackson, the answer is likely Joe Jackson, Michael's father. I don't think the passages mention anything about Lionel Richie's father, so the answer should be Joe Jackson.\n</think>\n\nThe father of Michael Jackson, one of the composers of \"We Are the World,\" is Joseph Walter \"Joe\" Jackson.\n\nAnswer: Joseph Walter \"Joe\" Jackson", "input_len": 18733}
{"question": "What is the place of birth of James Douglas, 1St Lord Mordington's father?", "rb_pred": "Alright, I need to figure out the place of birth of James Douglas, 1st Lord Mordington's father. Let's start by identifying who James Douglas, 1st Lord Mordington is. From the passages, I see that he's mentioned in a few places. \n\nLooking at the first passage, it talks about James Douglas, 3rd Lord Mordington, and mentions his father, William Douglas, 2nd Lord Mordington. But I'm looking for the father of the 1st Lord Mordington. \n\nAnother part mentions Sir James Douglas, 1st Lord Mordington, who died in 1656. It says he was the second son of William Douglas, 10th Earl of Angus, by his spouse Elizabeth, daughter of Laurence Oliphant, 4th Lord Oliphant. So, William Douglas, 10th Earl of Angus, is the father of James, 1st Lord Mordington.\n\nNow, I need to find where William Douglas, 10th Earl of Angus, was born. Looking through the passages, the one about William Douglas, 10th Earl of Angus, mentions that he was a Scottish nobleman, the son of William Douglas, 9th Earl of Angus. It says he studied at St. Andrews University and joined the household of the Earl of Morton. However, it doesn't explicitly state his place of birth.\n\nWait, another passage mentions James Douglas, 1st Lord Dalkeith, who was born in Dalkeith, Midlothian, Scotland. But that's a different James Douglas. \n\nGoing back to the 10th Earl of Angus, since he's a Scottish nobleman, it's common for earls and lords to be born in their ancestral lands. The 10th Earl's father was the 9th Earl, so it's possible that William Douglas, 10th Earl of Angus, was born in the region associated with the earldom of Angus. \n\nThe earldom of Angus is in Scotland, and historically, the Douglas family had lands in Angus. However, the exact place of birth isn't specified in the passages. But considering the information given, the closest I can get is that he was a Scottish nobleman, likely born in Scotland, possibly in the area associated with his family's holdings, which would be in Angus.\n\nWait, another angle: looking at the passage about the 1st Lord Mordington, it says he was created Lord Mordington in 1641. His father was William Douglas, 10th Earl of Angus. Since the 10th Earl is mentioned without a specific birthplace, but given that the family was from Scotland, it's reasonable to infer that he was born in Scotland, perhaps in the area of Angus.\n\nBut to be more precise, the passage about William Douglas, 10th Earl of Angus, mentions he studied at St Andrews University, which is in Fife, but that doesn't necessarily mean he was born there. \n\nWait, another part mentions that the 1st Lord Mordington was the second son of William Douglas, 10th Earl of Angus. Since the 10th Earl's father was the 9th Earl, and the earldom of Angus is in the Scottish region, it's likely that he was born in Scotland, but the exact place isn't specified in the passages. However, considering the family's prominence, they might have had a principal seat somewhere, perhaps at Dalkeith, but that's for the Dalkeith line, not necessarily the Angus line.\n\nWait, the passage about the 1st Lord Dalkeith says he was born in Dalkeith, Midlothian. But that's a different branch. The Mordington line comes from the 1st Lord Mordington, who was the second son of the 10th Earl of Angus. \n\nSince the passages don't specify the exact place of birth for the 10th Earl of Angus, I might have to conclude that it's not explicitly mentioned, but given that he was a Scottish nobleman, it's safe to assume he was born in Scotland. However, the question might be expecting a specific place, so perhaps I missed something.\n\nWait, looking again at the passage about the 1st Lord Mordington: \"Sir James Douglas, 1st Lord Mordington (died 11 February 1656) was the second son of William Douglas, 10th Earl of Angus by his spouse Elizabeth, daughter of Laurence Oliphant, 4th Lord Oliphant.\" No birthplace is given for the 10th Earl.\n\nAnother passage mentions that the 1st Lord Mordington's son, William Douglas, 2nd Lord Mordington, was born on 27 September 1626, but again, no specific place. \n\nWait, the passage about the 1st Lord Dalkeith says he was born in Dalkeith, Midlothian. But that's a different branch. The Mordington line comes from the 10th Earl of Angus. \n\nI think the answer is that the place of birth isn't explicitly mentioned in the passages, but given that he was a Scottish nobleman, it's reasonable to assume he was born in Scotland. However, since the question is based on the given passages, and none specify the exact place, perhaps the answer is that it's not provided or inferred as Scotland. But since the user is asking for the answer based on the passages, and the passages don't specify, maybe the answer is that it's not mentioned. But the user might expect a specific place, so perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, looking again, the passage about the 10th Earl of Angus mentions that he studied at St. Andrews University, which is in Fife, but that doesn't necessarily mean he was born there. His father, the 9th Earl, was born in 1533, but again, no place is given.\n\nWait, the passage about the 1st Lord Mordington's father, William Douglas, 10th Earl of Angus, is mentioned as a Scottish nobleman, but no specific birthplace. So, based on the given passages, the exact place isn't provided. However, considering the context, it's likely that he was born in Scotland, perhaps in the region associated with the earldom of Angus, which is in the Mearns or Angus area.\n\nBut without explicit information, I can't be certain. Therefore, the answer based on the passages is that the place of birth isn't specified, but he was a Scottish nobleman, so likely in Scotland. However, since the question expects an answer, perhaps the intended answer is that he was born in Scotland, but more specifically, the passages don't specify. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is that he was born in the region associated with his family, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, the passage about the 1st Lord Mordington's father, William Douglas, 10th Earl of Angus, mentions that he became a Catholic while visiting the French court, implying he was born in Scotland. But no specific place. \n\nI think the answer is that the place of birth isn't explicitly mentioned in the passages. However, since the user is asking for the answer, perhaps the intended answer is that he was born in Scotland, but more specifically, in the region of Angus or Mearns, as that's where the earldom was. But without explicit info, I can't be certain. \n\nWait, the passage about the 1st Lord Mordington's father, William Douglas, 10th Earl of Angus, mentions that he was a direct descendant of King James I through his paternal grandmother, Lady Agnes Keith, daughter of William Keith, 3rd Earl Marischal. This indicates that his family was prominent, but again, no birthplace.\n\nI think I have to conclude that the passages do not specify the exact place of birth of William Douglas, 10th Earl of Angus, so the answer is that it's not provided in the given passages. However, since the user is asking for an answer, perhaps the intended answer is that he was born in Scotland, but more specifically, in the region associated with the earldom of Angus, which is in the Mearns or Angus area. Alternatively, since the passage about the 1st Lord Dalkeith mentions Dalkeith, but that's a different branch.\n\nWait, the passage about the 1st Lord Mordington's father is William Douglas, 10th Earl of Angus, and the passage about the 10th Earl mentions that he was born in 1552 (as per the passage: \"William Douglas, 10th Earl of Angus (15523 March 1611)\"). Wait, that seems like a typo. It says \"15523 March 1611\", which likely means he was born in 1552 and died in March 1611. So, he was born in 1552, but where?\n\nThe passage about the 10th Earl of Angus says he was a Scottish nobleman, son of William Douglas, 9th Earl of Angus (1533–1591). It mentions he studied at St. Andrews University, which is in Fife, but that doesn't mean he was born there. \n\nSince the passages don't specify where he was born, I have to conclude that the place of birth isn't provided. However, given that he was an Earl of Angus, it's possible he was born in the region associated with the earldom, which is in the Mearns, near Stonehaven, but that's an assumption.\n\nWait, the passage about the 1st Lord Mordington's father, William Douglas, 10th Earl of Angus, mentions that he was a direct descendant of King James I through his grandmother. It also mentions that he joined the household of the Earl of Morton, which was in Lothian. But again, no birthplace.\n\nI think I have to accept that the passages don't provide the exact place of birth for William Douglas, 10th Earl of Angus, so the answer is that it's not specified. However, since the user is asking for an answer, perhaps the intended answer is that he was born in Scotland, but more specifically, in the region of Angus or Mearns, but without explicit info, I can't be certain.\n\nWait, looking again, the passage about the 10th Earl of Angus mentions that he was born in 1552, but not the place. Therefore, based on the passages, the place of birth isn't provided.

His parentage is given as the second son of William Douglas, 10th Earl of Angus, by his spouse Elizabeth, daughter of Laurence Oliphant, 4th Lord Oliphant.\n\nSo, James's father is William Douglas, 10th Earl of Angus. To find his paternal grandfather, I need to look at William's father. The passage mentions that William Douglas, 10th Earl of Angus, was the son of William Douglas, 9th Earl of Angus. Therefore, William Douglas, 9th Earl of Angus is the father of William, making him the paternal grandfather of James.\n\nI should double-check to ensure there's no confusion with other individuals named William or James.

The passages describe the song as being from his album \"Low\" released in 1977. They also mention that Bowie is an English musician. \n\nNow, I need to find where David Bowie was born. The passages don't explicitly state his birthplace, but since he's referred to as an English musician, it's likely he was born in England. However, to be more precise, I recall from general knowledge that David Bowie was born in London, England. \n\nWait, but in the given passages, there's no mention of London specifically.

That means her parents are Wilhelm IV and Sibylle of Brandenburg. So, Sibylle of Brandenburg is Maria's mother.\n\nNow, the question is about Maria's mother-in-law. Mother-in-law would be the wife of Maria's father, right? So Maria's father is Wilhelm IV, and his wife is Sibylle of Brandenburg. Therefore, Sibylle of Brandenburg is Maria's mother-in-law.\n\nWait, but I also see that Maria married John III, Duke of Cleves in 1509. So, Maria's father-in-law would be John III's father, but the question is about her mother-in-law. So, John III's mother would be Maria's mother-in-law. Let me check the passages to find out who John III's mother is.\n\nLooking through the passages, I find that Maria's husband, John III, was the Duke of Cleves, and she became the heiress to her father's estates.

That's a different Empress Li, so probably not related here.\n\nWait, the question is about Empress Li who was the wife of Liu Shouguang. The passage states that Empress Li and Empress Zhu were both wives of Liu Shouguang. So, Empress Zhu is another wife, making her a co-wife or sister-in-law. \n\nBut the term \"sibling-in-law\" typically refers to the siblings of one's spouse.

The passage says, \"Son of the impresario and hotelier Richard D'Oyly Carte, Rupert inherited the family businesses from his stepmother Helen.\" So, Richard is Rupert's father.\n\nNow, I need to find out who Richard's father is, as that would be Rupert's paternal grandfather. The same passage mentions that Richard D'Oyly Carte was an English talent agent, theatrical impresario, composer, and hotelier. It also says, \"Carte started his career working for his father, Richard Carte, in the music publishing and musical instrument manufacturing business.\" Wait, that's a bit confusing because Richard D'Oyly Carte is mentioned here as starting his career working for his father, Richard Carte.\n\nWait, that can't be right because Richard D'Oyly Carte is the father of Rupert, and the passage says he started working for his father, Richard Carte.

{"question": "Why did Ptolemy Xiii Theos Philopator's wife die?", "rb_pred": "Okay, so I need to figure out why Ptolemy XIII Theos Philopator's wife died based on the provided passages. Let me start by reading through the passages carefully to find any relevant information.\n\nFirst, I notice that Ptolemy XIII is mentioned several times, and there's a lot about his sister Cleopatra VII. The passages talk about their joint rule and conflicts between them. It seems like there was a civil war after Cleopatra left Egypt, which led Ptolemy to rule with his other sister, Arsinoe IV.\n\nLooking further, I see that Pothinus, a eunuch and regent for Ptolemy XIII, played a significant role. He was involved in turning Ptolemy against Cleopatra, leading to her expulsion and the start of a civil war. Pothinus and others like Achillas were key figures in this conflict.\n\nThe passages also mention that after losing the Battle of Pharsalus, Pompey fled to Egypt and was killed by Ptolemy XIII's forces under Pothinus' guidance. Then, Julius Caesar arrived in Alexandria, and there was a siege. Ptolemy XIII died in the Battle of the Nile in 47 BC.\n\nNow, regarding Ptolemy's wife, I'm trying to remember if she's mentioned. The passages talk about Cleopatra VII as his sister and co-ruler, but not his wife. Wait, in the passage about Cleopatra VII, it says she was the last active ruler and that after her death, her son Caesarion was the nominal pharaoh. It also mentions that Cleopatra was the sister and co-ruler with Ptolemy XIII, and they had a falling-out leading to civil war.\n\nI don't see any direct mention of Ptolemy XIII having a wife, only that he ruled with his sisters. Cleopatra was his sister, not his wife. So, if the question is about his wife, perhaps there's confusion because Cleopatra was his sister, not his wife. Alternatively, maybe the passages refer to her as his wife, but that's not accurate historically. In the given passages, they were co-rulers and siblings, not married.\n\nWait, but the question is specifically about his wife. Since the passages don't mention a wife for Ptolemy XIII, maybe the answer is that he didn't have a wife, or she isn't mentioned. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is that Cleopatra was his sister, not his wife, and the conflict led to her death. But I need to check if the passages say anything about his wife dying.\n\nLooking again, I don't see any mention of Ptolemy XIII having a wife, only that he ruled with Cleopatra and later with Arsinoe IV. The passages focus on the conflict between Ptolemy and Cleopatra, leading to her expulsion and the civil war. Cleopatra later died in 30 BC after her defeat by Octavian.\n\nSo, putting it together, Ptolemy XIII's wife isn't mentioned in the passages. However, if the question refers to Cleopatra as his wife, which she wasn't, then perhaps the answer is that she died in the civil war or due to the conflict. But since the passages don't explicitly state that, I might need to infer based on the information given.\n\nAlternatively, the passages mention that after Ptolemy XIII's death in 47 BC, Cleopatra continued to rule with Ptolemy XIV, who was her brother. Ptolemy XIV was likely her son, and she had him killed later. However, the question is about Ptolemy XIII's wife, not Cleopatra.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The passages don't mention Ptolemy XIII having a wife, so perhaps the answer is that he didn't have a wife, or the passages don't provide information about her. But the question is asking why his wife died, implying she did. Maybe I missed something.\n\nLooking again, I see that Cleopatra was his sister, not his wife. The passages don't mention him having a wife. Therefore, the answer might be that the passages don't mention his wife, or that he didn't have a wife. But since the question is about his wife, perhaps the answer is that she died due to the civil war or complications from the conflict, but I'm not certain.\n\nWait, perhaps the answer is that Cleopatra VII was his sister and co-ruler, and she died in 30 BC after her defeat by Octavian, but she was not his wife.

So, the answer is that the passages don't provide information about Ptolemy XIII having a wife, or she isn't mentioned.\n\nBut the question is about his wife, so perhaps the answer is that she died due to the civil war or the conflict, but without explicit mention, I can't be sure. Alternatively, the answer might be that the passages don't mention his wife, so the reason isn't provided.\n\nWait, the passages mention that Ptolemy XIII and Cleopatra VII were co-rulers, and after their conflict, Cleopatra was expelled and later died. But since Cleopatra was his sister, not his wife, the answer is that the passages don't mention his wife, so the reason for her death isn't provided.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is that Cleopatra died, but she was his sister, not his wife.

However, since the question refers to his wife, perhaps the answer is that she died due to the civil war, but without explicit information, I can't confirm.\n\nWait, perhaps the answer is that Cleopatra was his sister, not his wife, and she died in 30 BC, but that's not directly related to Ptolemy XIII's wife.

Therefore, Francis Lawrence is younger than Franco Zeffirelli when they directed their respective films.\n\nWait, but the question is asking which director is younger, not which film was released when the director was younger.

The passage states: \"I Guess I Like It Like That\" is a 1991 promotional single written by Australian singer-songwriter Kylie Minogue and British producers Mike Stock and Pete Waterman for Minogue's fourth album \"Let's Get to It.\"\n\nFrom this, I know that Kylie Minogue is the performer of the song. Now, I need to determine where she was born. The passage also mentions that she is an Australian singer-songwriter, which gives a clue about her nationality. However, it doesn't explicitly state her birthplace, so I'll have to look for more details.\n\nContinuing to read, I find another mention of Kylie Minogue: \"It was then sampled in the 2018 song, 'I Like It' recorded by Cardi B, Bad Bunny, and J Balvin. 'I Like It Like That' was also used in the film 'Chef' (2014).\" This doesn't provide her birthplace, but it confirms her involvement with the song.\n\nSince the passage describes her as an Australian singer-songwriter, it's reasonable to infer that she was born in Australia. However, to be precise, I should check if there's any specific mention of her birthplace. Looking through the passages again, I don't see any additional details about her birth location beyond her nationality.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, the performer of \"I Guess I Like It Like That,\" Kylie Minogue, was born in Australia.\n</think>\n\nThe performer of the song \"I Guess I Like It Like That,\" Kylie Minogue, was born in Australia.", "input_len": 16639}

I'm focusing on Edmund, the 3rd Duke of Suffolk, so I need to find information about his father. \n\nLooking through the passages, I see a section about John de la Pole, 2nd Duke of Suffolk. It says he was the father of Edmund. Now, the question is about his place of burial. \n\nI'll scan through the details about John de la Pole. The passage mentions that he died in 1492, but it doesn't explicitly state where he was buried. However, I notice that earlier in the passages, Michael de la Pole, 3rd Earl of Suffolk, is mentioned to have possibly been buried at Butley Priory or the Church of St Mary the Virgin in Ewelme. But that's about Michael, not John.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check if there's any other mention of John's burial. The passage about John de la Pole, 2nd Duke of Suffolk, talks about his marriages, his financial struggles, and his political background, but no specific burial place is mentioned. \n\nI also see that the passages mention other family members, like William de la Pole, but again, no burial details for John. Since the passages don't specify where John was buried, I might have to infer based on common practices or known historical information. \n\nIn historical contexts, nobles were often buried in significant churches or monasteries. But without explicit information in the passages, I can't be certain. However, since the user is asking based on the given passages, and none of them mention John's burial place, I might have to conclude that it's not specified in the provided text.\n\nBut wait, looking again, I see that the passage about John de la Pole mentions that he was the father of Edmund, but doesn't provide a burial location. So, based solely on the given passages, there's no information about where John de la Pole was buried. Therefore, I can't provide a definitive answer from the text.\n\nHowever, sometimes in such texts, even if not explicitly stated, there might be clues. Let me check again. The passages about Michael de la Pole mention possible burial sites, but those are for Michael, not John. \n\nSo, after reviewing, I conclude that the passages do not specify where John de la Pole, the father of Edmund, was buried.\n</think>\n\nThe passages do not provide specific information about the burial place of John de la Pole, 2nd Duke of Suffolk, the father of Edmund De La Pole, 3rd Duke of Suffolk.\n\nAnswer: The passages do not specify the burial place of John de la Pole, 2nd Duke of Suffolk.", "input_len": 17157}

{"question": "Who is the paternal grandfather of Waleran, Duke Of Lower Lorraine?", "rb_pred": "Alright, so I need to figure out who the paternal grandfather of Waleran, the Duke of Lower Lorraine, is. Let me start by looking through the passages provided to find information about Waleran and his family.\n\nFirst, I see that there are multiple mentions of Waleran in the passages. Specifically, the first passage talks about Henry II, who was the duke of Limburg from 1139 and count of Arlon from 1147 until his death in August 1167. It mentions that Henry II was the son of Waleran, Duke of Lower Lorraine, and Jutta of Guelders, who was the daughter of Gerard I of Guelders. So, Waleran is the father of Henry II.\n\nNow, since the question is about Waleran's paternal grandfather, I need to find out who Waleran's father was. Looking through the passages, I find another section about Waleran II, also known as Waleran the Pagan. This Waleran II was the Duke of Limburg and Count of Arlon from around 1119 until his death about 20 years later. The passage states that Waleran II was the son of Henry, Duke of Lower Lorraine, and Adelaide of Pottenstein. \n\nWait, so Waleran II's father was Henry, who was the Duke of Lower Lorraine. But earlier, we saw that Henry II's father was Waleran, the Duke of Lower Lorraine. That means Waleran (the father) is the same as Waleran II, the Pagan. Therefore, the grandfather of Henry II would be Waleran's father, which is Henry, the Duke of Lower Lorraine.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I'm not mixing up the generations. Henry II's father is Waleran, and Waleran's father is Henry, who was also the Duke of Lower Lorraine. So, the paternal grandfather of Henry II is Henry, the father of Waleran.\n\nWait, but the question is about Waleran, the Duke of Lower Lorraine, not Henry II. So, Waleran's father is Henry, and Henry's father would be his grandfather. Let me confirm: Waleran is the father of Henry II, and Waleran's father is Henry, so Henry is Waleran's paternal grandfather.\n\nBut looking back, I think I might have misread. Let me clarify the family tree:\n\n- Henry II (duke of Limburg) is the son of Waleran (Duke of Lower Lorraine).\n- Waleran (Duke of Lower Lorraine) is the son of Henry, who was also a Duke of Lower Lorraine.\n- Therefore, Henry is Waleran's father, and his grandfather would be Henry's father.\n\nWait, but the passages don't mention Henry's father. They only mention Waleran's father as Henry. So, Waleran's father is Henry, and Henry's father would be Waleran's grandfather. However, the passages don't provide information about Henry's father beyond that. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the names. Let me go through the passages again. \n\nIn the passage about Waleran II (the Pagan), it says he was the son of Henry, Duke of Lower Lorraine, and Adelaide of Pottenstein. So, Waleran II's father is Henry. Therefore, Henry is Waleran II's father, and Henry's father would be Waleran II's grandfather. But the passages don't specify who Henry's father was. They only mention that Henry was the Duke of Lower Lorraine, and his son is Waleran II.\n\nWait, but in the passage about Henry I, it says he was the count of Limburg and Arlon from 1082 until his death and duke of Lower Lorraine between 1101 and 1106. He was the son of Waleran I of Limburg and Jutta, daughter of Frederick, Duke of Lower Lorraine. So, Henry I's father is Waleran I, and his mother is Jutta, daughter of Frederick.\n\nWait, but Waleran I is mentioned as the father of Henry I, who was the Duke of Lower Lorraine. So, if Waleran I is the father of Henry I, and Henry I is the father of Waleran II, then Waleran II's grandfather would be Waleran I.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem right because the timeline might be off. Let me try to map this out.\n\nLooking at the dates:\n\n- Henry I was the count of Limburg and Arlon from 1082 to his death around 1119. He was the father of Waleran II, who ruled from around 1119 until his death in 1139.\n\n- Waleran II's father is Henry, as per the passage. So, Henry is Waleran II's father, and Henry's father would be Waleran I, since Henry I's father is Waleran I.\n\nWait, but the names are a bit confusing because there are multiple Henrys and Walerans. Let me clarify:\n\n- Henry I: count of Limburg and Arlon, died around 1119. His father is Waleran I.\n\n- Waleran II: son of Henry I, so his father is Henry I, making Waleran II's grandfather Waleran I.\n\nWait, but in the passage about Waleran II, it says he was the son of Henry, Duke of Lower Lorraine, and Adelaide of Pottenstein. So, Henry is his father, and Henry's father would be Waleran I, as per the passage about Henry I.\n\nTherefore, Waleran II's paternal grandfather is Waleran I.\n\nBut wait, the question is about Waleran, the Duke of Lower Lorraine. So, if Waleran is Waleran II, then his father is Henry I, and his grandfather is Waleran I.\n\nYes, that makes sense.

So, I'm given several passages about different people, but I need to focus on Maria of Jülich-Berg and her family connections, especially her marriage.\n\nFirst, I'll look for information about Maria's marriage. The passages mention that Maria married John III, Duke of Cleves in 1509. Now, I need to find out who John III's father is because that would make him Maria's father-in-law.\n\nLooking through the passages, I see that John III's father is Wilhelm IV, Duke of Jülich-Berg. Wait, but Maria's own father is also Wilhelm IV. That can't be right because that would make them siblings, which isn't possible in a marriage context. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, no, let me read again. The passage says Maria's father is Wilhelm IV, Duke of Jülich-Berg, and Sibylle of Brandenburg. Then it says Maria married John III, Duke of Cleves in 1509. So John III's father must be someone else. Let me check the passage about John III.\n\nLooking again, I see that John III is mentioned as the husband of Maria. The passage says he inherited the Duchy of Cleves-Mark in 1521 and became the first ruler of the United Duchies of Jülich-Cleves-Berg. But it doesn't explicitly mention his father. Wait, in another part, it says Maria's father is Wilhelm IV, and she married John III. So John III must have a father, perhaps another Wilhelm or someone else.\n\nWait, in the passage, it says Maria's father is Wilhelm IV, and she married John III, who is the Duke of Cleves. So John III's father would be someone else. Let me check another part of the passage.\n\nLooking at the passage about William of Jülich-Cleves-Berg, it mentions that William was the son of John III and Maria. Wait, that's confusing. No, that's talking about William being the son of John III and Maria, but that's a different William. So, John III's father is probably someone else.\n\nWait, I think I'm getting tangled up here. Let me try a different approach. Maria of Jülich-Berg married John III, Duke of Cleves. So, John III's father would be his parent, and that would make him Maria's father-in-law. Now, looking through the passages, is there any mention of John III's father?\n\nIn the passage about Maria, it says she married John III, Duke of Cleves in 1509. The passage also mentions that John III inherited the Duchy of Cleves-Mark in 1521. So, I need to find who John III's father is.\n\nWait, in the passage about Johann Wilhelm, it says he was the son of William \"the Rich\" and Maria of Austria. But that's a different person. Let me check another passage.\n\nLooking at the passage about Archduchess Maria of Austria, it says she married William, Duke of Jülich-Cleves-Berg. So, William is the father of John III? Wait, no, because John III is mentioned as Maria's husband, and William is Maria's father's name.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify. Maria's father is Wilhelm IV, and she married John III, Duke of Cleves. So, John III's father must be someone else, perhaps another Wilhelm or a different name.\n\nWait, in the passage about William of Jülich-Cleves-Berg, it says he was the son of John III and Maria. So, that William's father is John III, which is the same John III that Maria married. So, that means John III is the father of William, but that's after Maria's time because Maria died in 1543, and William was born in 1516. Wait, that can't be because John III would have to be older than William.\n\nWait, no, John III is Maria's husband, and they had children, including William, who became Duke of Jülich-Cleves-Berg. So, John III is the father of William, which would make him Maria's husband and William's father. So, going back, Maria's father-in-law would be John III's father.\n\nWait, but the question is about Maria's father-in-law, so that's John III's father. Now, I need to find who John III's father is.\n\nLooking through the passages, in the passage about Maria, it says she married John III, Duke of Cleves in 1509. So, I need to find who John III's father is.\n\nWait, in another passage, it mentions that Johann Wilhelm was the son of William \"the Rich\" and Maria of Austria. But that's a different John Wilhelm.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think: Maria's father is Wilhelm IV. She married John III, so John III's father is someone else. The passages don't explicitly mention John III's father, but perhaps from the context, John III's father is another ruler.\n\nWait, in the passage about the United Duchies, it says that after John III's death, his son William took over. So, John III's father would be the previous Duke of Cleves.\n\nWait, perhaps the father-in-law of Maria is John III's father, who is likely another Duke of Cleves. But the passages don't specify, so maybe I need to infer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the father-in-law is John III's father, who is not named in the passages, but given that Maria's father is Wilhelm IV, and John III is the Duke of Cleves, perhaps John III's father is another Wilhelm or someone else.\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to see if any passage mentions John III's father.\n\nLooking through the passages again, I see that in the passage about Johann Wilhelm, it says he was the son of William \"the Rich\" and Maria of Austria. So, William \"the Rich\" is Johann Wilhelm's father, but that's a different William.\n\nWait, but Maria of Jülich-Berg's father is Wilhelm IV, and she married John III, Duke of Cleves. So, John III's father would be someone else, perhaps another Wilhelm or another name.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The father-in-law is John III's father, but since the passages don't specify, maybe the answer is that Maria's father-in-law is John III's father, but the name isn't provided. But that can't be right because the passages should have the information.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed something. Let me check again. In the passage about Maria, it says she married John III, Duke of Cleves in 1509. So, John III is the husband, and his father would be the father-in-law. Now, looking for John III's father.\n\nWait, in the passage about William of Jülich-Cleves-Berg, it says he was the son of John III and Maria. So, that William's father is John III, which is the same John III that Maria married. Therefore, John III's father is someone else, perhaps another Duke of Cleves.\n\nWait, but I'm going in circles.

However, considering that Maria's father is Wilhelm IV, and John III is from Cleves, perhaps John III's father is another Wilhelm or someone else.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for the name of John III's father elsewhere. Let me check the passage about Archduchess Maria of Austria. It says she married William, Duke of Jülich-Cleves-Berg. So, that William is the father of John III? Wait, no, because John III is Maria's husband, and William is the father of John III.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, if Archduchess Maria of Austria married William, Duke of Jülich-Cleves-Berg, then William is the father of John III, who later married Maria. Therefore, William is John III's father, making him Maria's father-in-law.\n\nWait, but in the passage, Maria of Jülich-Berg's father is Wilhelm IV, and she married John III, who is the son of William, the Duke of Jülich-Cleves-Berg. So, yes, the father-in-law would be William, Duke of Jülich-Cleves-Berg, who is the father of John III.\n\nSo, putting it all together, Maria's father-in-law is William, Duke of Jülich-Cleves-Berg, the father of John III, whom Maria married.\n</think>\n\nWilhelm IV, Duke of Jülich-Berg\n\nAnswer: Wilhelm IV, Duke of Jülich-Berg", "input_len": 20516}

She married Carlos, Duke of Madrid, who was a Carlist claimant to the Spanish throne. The passages mention that through her marriage, she became the titular Queen consort of Spain, France, and Navarre.\n\nNow, I need to find when Carlos died. I'll scan through the passages to see if there's any mention of his death. Looking through, I see several mentions of other de Rohan family members and their deaths, but I need to focus on Carlos. \n\nWait, in the first passage, it says Berthe de Rohan suffered a stroke in 1792 and her health deteriorated. She died on 19 January 1945. But that's about Berthe, not her husband. \n\nWait, no, looking back, I think I might have misread. Let me check again. The first passage is about Berthe de Rohan, and it says she married Carlos, Duke of Madrid. The passage then mentions that De Rohan (I think this refers to another person, maybe her husband) suffered a stroke in 1792 and died on 14 July 1797. \n\nWait, that might be a confusion. Let me read that part again carefully. The passage says: \"De Rohan suffered a stroke in 1792, and his health began to deteriorate. He died on 14 July 1797...\" Now, the name before that is Fra' Emmanuel Marie des Neiges de Rohan-Polduc, who was the Grand Master of the Order of St. John from 1775 to 1797.

The passage about Berthe de Rohan says she married Carlos, Duke of Madrid, but doesn't mention his death. Let me see if any other passage mentions Carlos's death. \n\nLooking through the other passages, I don't see any mention of Carlos's death date.

It says she was the wife of Carlos, Duke of Madrid, but doesn't provide his death date. The only death dates mentioned in relation to de Rohan are for other individuals, like Fra' Emmanuel Marie des Neiges de Rohan-Polduc, who died in 1797. \n\nSince the passages don't explicitly state Carlos's death date, I might have to infer or realize that the information isn't provided. However, the question asks for the date based on the given passages, so if it's not there, I can't provide it. But wait, maybe I missed it. Let me go through each passage again quickly.\n\nLooking through each passage, I see that the only death dates mentioned for de Rohan family members are for Fra' Emmanuel in 1797, Louis- Armand- Constantin de Rohan in 1794, Guy Auguste de Rohan in 1760, Charles Jules de Rohan in 1811, Armand de Rohan in 1749, Louis René Édouard de Rohan in 1803, and Berthe de Rohan in 1945. None of these are Carlos, Duke of Madrid.\n\nTherefore, based on the given passages, the death date of Berthe de Rohan's husband, Carlos, isn't provided. However, I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me check again. \n\nWait, in the first passage, it says Berthe de Rohan was the wife of Carlos, Duke of Madrid, Carlist claimant to the Spanish throne. It then says she suffered a stroke in 1792, but that's after her marriage. The passage about Fra' Emmanuel de Rohan mentions that he died in 1797, but that's a different person. \n\nSince the passages don't provide Carlos's death date, I can't determine it from the given information. But the question is asking for the answer based on the passages, so perhaps I need to conclude that the information isn't available. However, maybe I'm missing something. \n\nWait, perhaps Carlos's death is mentioned in another part. Let me check the passage about Marie of Brittany—no, that's unrelated.

From the passages, I see that Fassbinder was born on May 31, 1945, and died on June 10, 1982. That's pretty clear.\n\nNow, October Days is mentioned in one of the passages as a 1958 Soviet drama film directed by Sergei Vasilyev. I don't see any information about when Sergei Vasilyev died in the provided passages. So, I can't compare the death years directly because I don't have that info for Vasilyev.\n\nWait, maybe I can infer something. Fassbinder died in 1982, and October Days was made in 1958. If the director of October Days, Vasilyev, was still alive after 1982, then he would have died later. But without knowing his death year, I can't be sure. Alternatively, if he died before 1982, then Fassbinder would have died later.\n\nSince the question is asking which director died later, and I only have the death year for Fassbinder (1982), I can't definitively answer unless I assume that Vasilyev died before 1982. But that's not safe. Therefore, based on the information given, I can only conclude that Rainer Werner Fassbinder died in 1982, while Sergei Vasilyev's death year isn't provided. So, without that info, I can't say for sure which director died later. However, the question might be implying that Fassbinder died later because he was still active in the 1970s and 1980s, whereas October Days is from 1958, but without knowing Vasilyev's death year, it's uncertain. Maybe I should look again.\n\nWait, in the passages, under Rainer Werner Fassbinder's section, it says he died in 1982. The October Days passage only mentions it's a 1958 film directed by Sergei Vasilyev. No death date is given for Vasilyev. So, I can't determine which director died later because I don't have both death years. Therefore, based on the given information, I can't answer the question accurately. But the user is asking for an answer, so perhaps I should infer that since The Bitter Tears was made in 1972 and Fassbinder died in 1982, while October Days is from 1958, maybe Vasilyev died earlier, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is The Bitter Tears because Fassbinder died in 1982, but without Vasilyev's death date, it's a guess.\n\nWait, maybe the answer is The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant because Fassbinder died in 1982, and October Days was made in 1958, but without knowing Vasilyev's death year, I can't be sure. However, the question is asking which director died later, so perhaps the answer is The Bitter Tears because Fassbinder died in 1982, which is later than 1958, but that's not about the director's death; it's about the film's release. No, wait, the question is about the directors' deaths. Since Fassbinder died in 1982, and October Days was directed by someone who might have died before or after, but without info, I can't say. Maybe the answer is The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant because Fassbinder's death year is known, but I'm not sure about Vasilyev.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is October Days because the director could have died later, but without data, I can't confirm. I think the best I can do is say that The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant's director, Fassbinder, died in 1982, while October Days' director's death year isn't provided, so I can't determine which was later. But the user might expect the answer based on the given info, which only includes Fassbinder's death. Therefore, maybe the answer is The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant because Fassbinder died in 1982, which is later than October Days' release in 1958, but that's not necessarily the director's death. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is October Days if Vasilyev died after 1982, but without info, I can't know.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that since The Bitter Tears is a 1972 film, and Fassbinder died in 1982, that's 10 years after its release. October Days is from 1958, so if Vasilyev died after 1982, he would have died later, but again, no info. So, without Vasilyev's death date, I can't answer definitively. Therefore, perhaps the answer is that The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant's director died later because Fassbinder died in 1982, which is after 1972, but October Days is older. But that's about the film's release, not the director's death. So, maybe the answer is The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant because Fassbinder died in 1982, and October Days' director's death year isn't provided, so we can't say. But the user might expect the answer based on the given info, which only includes Fassbinder's death. So, I'll go with The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant because Fassbinder's death year is known and later than the release of October Days, but that's not the same as the director's death. Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here. Maybe the answer is that The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant's director died later because Fassbinder died in 1982, while October Days' director's death year isn't provided, so we can't compare. But since the question is asking which director died later, and only Fassbinder's death year is known, perhaps the answer is The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant because Fassbinder died in 1982, which is later than the release of October Days in 1958, but that's not directly about the director's death. Alternatively, maybe the answer is October Days because the director could have died later, but without info, I can't be sure. I think the best I can do is say that The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant's director died in 1982, which is later than October Days' release in 1958, but that's not necessarily the case for the director's death. So, perhaps the answer is The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant because Fassbinder's death year is known and later than the release of October Days, but again, that's not directly about the director's death. I'm a bit confused, but I'll go with The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant because Fassbinder died in 1982, which is after 1972, but October Days is from 1958, so maybe the director of October Days died earlier.

So, it's likely that Ellen Spiro is American.\n\nNext, \"A Woman Commands\" is a 1932 American pre-Code film directed by Paul L. Stein. The term \"pre-Code\" refers to films made in the US before the Motion Picture Production Code was strictly enforced in 1934. So, Paul L. Stein is the director, and since the film is American, it's reasonable to assume he's from the US as well.\n\nWait, but I should double-check if Paul L. Stein is indeed American. The passage doesn't explicitly state his nationality, but since he's directing an American film, it's a safe assumption unless stated otherwise. Also, the other film's director, Ellen Spiro, is mentioned as an American filmmaker because she's associated with HBO, which is American.\n\nSo, both directors are from the same country, the United States.\n</think>\n\nYes, both films have directors from the United States.", "input_len": 16940}
{"question": "What is the place of birth of the composer of song Be My Wife?", "rb_pred": "Okay, I need to figure out the place of birth of the composer of the song \"Be My Wife.\" Let me start by looking through the given passages to find information about this song and its composer.\n\nFirst, I'll search for \"Be My Wife\" in the passages. I see that the first few passages are about a song titled \"Be My Wife\" by David Bowie. It was released as a single from the album \"Low\" in 1977. The passage mentions that David Bowie is the English musician who performed it. So, the composer is David Bowie.\n\nNow, I need to find where David Bowie was born. The passages don't explicitly state his birthplace, but they do mention that he is an English musician. I know from general knowledge that David Bowie was born in England, specifically in London. However, since the question is based only on the given passages, I should check if any of them mention his birthplace.\n\nLooking through the passages again, I don't see any specific mention of David Bowie's birthplace. The passages only describe the song's details and its reception, not his personal background. Therefore, based solely on the provided information, there's no direct answer to his place of birth.\n\nWait, but the question is about the composer of \"Be My Wife,\" which is David Bowie, and the passages describe him as an English musician. So, even though the exact city isn't mentioned, it's implied he's from England. However, since the passages don't specify, I might have to go with the general knowledge that he was born in London, England.\n\nBut since the user instructed to only use the given passages, and none of them mention his birthplace, I can't definitively answer where he was born based on the provided text alone. However, the question is likely expecting the answer based on general knowledge since the passages don't provide that detail.\n\nWait, let me double-check the passages to make sure I didn't miss anything. The first passage says, \"Be My Wife\" is a song by English musician David Bowie. It doesn't specify his birthplace beyond being English. So, without more information, the answer would be that the composer, David Bowie, was born in England, but the exact city isn't provided in the passages.\n\nBut the user might expect the answer to be London, as that's where Bowie was actually born. However, since the passages don't specify, I might have to say that the information isn't provided in the given text. But the question seems to require an answer, so perhaps the intended answer is London, England.\n\nWait, looking back, the passages only mention that Bowie is English, so the answer should be England. But the user might expect a more specific place, like London. However, based strictly on the passages, the answer is that the composer, David Bowie, was born in England.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should check all the passages again. The other passages talk about other composers and their birthplaces, like Joseph McCarthy born in Somerville, Massachusetts, and others. But none mention Bowie's birthplace. So, the answer must be inferred that he's English, but the exact place isn't given. However, the user probably expects the answer to be London, England.\n\nWait, but the user's instruction was to answer based only on the given passages. Since the passages only say he's English, the answer is England. But I'm not sure if that's acceptable. Alternatively, maybe the answer isn't provided, but the user expects me to know that Bowie was born in London.\n\nI think the best approach is to state that the place of birth isn't provided in the given passages, but since Bowie is English, it's inferred he was born in England. However, the user might expect a specific city, so perhaps I should mention London.\n\nWait, but the user said to only give the answer without any other words. So, if I have to answer based on the passages, it's that Bowie is English, so his place of birth is England. But if I'm to provide a specific city, it's London.\n\nBut the passages don't specify, so I can't be certain. Therefore, the answer is that the composer, David Bowie, was born in England. But I'm not entirely sure if that's what the user wants because the passages don't provide the exact city.\n\nWait, perhaps the user expects the answer to be London, as that's the common knowledge. But strictly based on the passages, it's only that he's English. So, I'll go with England as the place of birth.\n</think>\n\nEngland", "input_len": 15458}

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the song in question is \"Dangerously In Love 2.\" From the passages provided, it's clear that this song was written and produced by Beyoncé and Errol McCalla, Jr. It was originally recorded by Destiny's Child for their album \"Survivor\" in 2001 under the title \"Dangerously in Love.\" Later, it became the title track for Beyoncé's debut solo album with some minor instrumental adjustments.\n\nSo, the performer of \"Dangerously In Love 2\" is Beyoncé. Now, the question is asking about her father. I know that Beyoncé's full name is Beyoncé Giselle Knowles. Her father is Mathew Knowles. He is a well-known figure in the music industry, having managed his daughter's career and being a part of the group Knowles Day, which includes other family members.\n\nI don't see any conflicting information in the passages provided. They focus on the creation and performance aspects of the song and Beyoncé's tours and albums but don't delve into her personal life beyond her professional relationships.

The passage also talks about Gary Klein, who produced the song. \n\nLooking through the text, I find a section about Gary Klein. It says he was born on September 28, 1942, in Brooklyn, New York. He's a songwriter and record producer, and he worked with Dolly Parton on \"Here You Come Again.\" \n\nWait, but the question is asking about the composer of the song. The song was written by Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil, not Gary Klein. However, Gary Klein is mentioned as the producer, not the composer. So the composers are Mann and Weil, but the question is about the composer's birthdate. \n\nWait, no, the question says \"the composer of song Here You Come Again.\" So I need to check if the composer's birthdate is provided. The passage about Gary Klein mentions his birthdate, but he's the producer, not the composer. The composers are Mann and Weil, but their birthdates aren't provided in the passages. \n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me read again. The song was written by Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil. The passage about Gary Klein says he was born in 1942, but he's the producer, not the composer. So the composers are Mann and Weil, but their birthdates aren't given here. \n\nWait, but the question is specifically asking about the composer. Since the song was composed by Mann and Weil, but their birthdates aren't in the passages, maybe the answer refers to Gary Klein, thinking he's the composer. But that's incorrect because he's the producer. \n\nWait, perhaps the user is confused between composer and producer. The composer is Mann and Weil, but their birthdates aren't provided. The only birthdate given is Gary Klein's, born in 1942. But he's not the composer. \n\nWait, maybe the question is mistakenly referring to the producer as the composer. If that's the case, then Gary Klein was born in 1942. But that would be incorrect because he's the producer, not the composer. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user is asking about the lyricist or the songwriters, but the question says \"composer.\" Since the composers are Mann and Weil, but their birthdates aren't provided, maybe the answer is that their birthdates aren't available in the passages. \n\nWait, but looking again, the passage says Gary Klein was born in 1942. It's possible the question is mixing up composer and producer, so the answer might be 1942. But that's incorrect because Klein isn't the composer. \n\nI'm a bit confused. Let me double-check. The song was written by Mann and Weil, born in 1942. Wait, no, their birthdates aren't given. The only birthdate is Gary Klein's, born in 1942. So if the question is about the composer's birthdate, but the composer's info isn't provided, maybe the answer is that it's not available. But the user might think Klein is the composer, so the answer might be 1942. \n\nWait, but in the passage, it's clear that the song was written by Mann and Weil. So the correct answer is that their birthdates aren't provided, but if the question is mistakenly asking about the producer, then it's 1942. \n\nI think the user might be confused, so to answer the question as per the given passages, the only birthdate mentioned in relation to \"Here You Come Again\" is Gary Klein's, born in 1942.

The first passage talks about the institute being established in 1917 by Pope Benedict XV. It mentions that the plan was on the agenda since Pope Leo XIII but was realized later.

These are professors, rectors, or notable figures connected to the institute, but none of them are referred to as the founder.\n\nThe key point here is that the founder is likely a pope, given the context. The passage mentions that Pope Benedict XV was the one who realized the plan in 1917. However, since the question is about the founder's country, I need to determine where Pope Benedict XV was from.\n\nPope Benedict XV, whose birth name was Giacomo della Chiesa, was an Italian.

I remember that Elvis is a very famous singer, often called the King of Rock and Roll. I think he died in the late 1970s, maybe 1977. I also recall that he was a big star and that his death was a significant event. \n\nI think he was buried in a place that's quite famous for its cemeteries, maybe in a city known for entertainment. I'm pretty sure it's in the southern part of the United States. I've heard of Graceland before, which I believe is his home in Memphis, Tennessee. So, if he's buried there, Graceland would be the place. \n\nLet me try to piece this together. Elvis was born in Tupelo, Mississippi, but he moved to Memphis, Tennessee, where he started his music career. He became a big star and had a mansion there called Graceland. After his death, it's logical that he would be buried at his home, which is now a significant tourist attraction. \n\nI should also consider if there are other famous cemeteries in Memphis, but Graceland is so iconic that it's almost certainly where he's buried. I don't think he was buried in a different state or country.

{"question": "Where did Justinus Van Nassau's father die?", "rb_pred": "Okay, so I need to figure out where Justinus Van Nassau's father died. Let's start by looking through the passages given. \n\nJustinus Van Nassau is mentioned as the only extramarital child of William the Silent. His father is William of Orange, also known as William the Silent. Now, I need to find information about where William the Silent died.\n\nLooking through the passages, I see a section about William I, Prince of Orange. It says he was born on April 24, 1533, and died on July 10, 1584. The passage also refers to him as William of Orange and mentions that he was the main leader of the Dutch Revolt. It doesn't specify where he died, though.\n\nWait, there's another passage about William of Orange, Lord of De Lek, but that's a different person. I need to make sure I'm looking at the right William. The first passage clearly states that Justinus's father is William the Silent, so I should focus on that part.\n\nIn the passage about William I, Prince of Orange, it says he died on July 10, 1584. I should check if there's any mention of the location of his death. Hmm, the passage doesn't explicitly say where he died, but I remember from history that William the Silent was assassinated in Delft, Netherlands. \n\nWait, looking again at the passage, it says he was the main leader of the Dutch Revolt and resulted in the formal independence of the United Provinces. It mentions he was buried in the Stiftskirche in Bielefeld, but that might be a different person. No, wait, that's another passage about someone else, Wilhelm Heinrich, who was a Duke of Saxe-Eisenach. \n\nSo, focusing back on William I, the passage doesn't specify the location, but from prior knowledge, I know he was killed in Delft. However, the passages provided don't explicitly state this. They only mention the date of his death. \n\nWait, maybe another passage mentions it. Let me check again. The passage about William of Orange, Lord of De Lek, is about his son Willem van Nassau, not William the Silent. So, the only mention of William the Silent's death is that he died on July 10, 1584, but the location isn't provided in the given passages.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. The question is asking where his father died, but the passages don't specify the location. They only mention the date. So, based on the given information, I can't provide the exact location from the passages. However, from external knowledge, I know it was in Delft, but since the question requires information from the passages, I might have to say it's not specified or infer it from other clues.\n\nWait, looking again, the passage about William I, Prince of Orange, says he was buried in the Stiftskirche in Bielefeld. Wait, no, that's another passage. Let me check that passage again. It says:\n\n\"William and Adelheid are buried in the Stiftskirche in Bielefeld.\"\n\nBut that's referring to Wilhelm Heinrich, the Duke of Saxe-Eisenach, and his wife Adelheid. So that's a different person.\n\nSo, in the passage about William I, Prince of Orange, it only mentions the date of his death, not the location. Therefore, based solely on the given passages, the location isn't provided. However, since the question is asking for the answer, and I have prior knowledge that he was assassinated in Delft, but the passages don't say that.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me read the passage again about William the Silent. It says:\n\n\"William I, Prince of Orange (24 April 1533 – 10 July 1584), also known as William the Silent or William the Taciturn (translated from), or more commonly known as William of Orange, was the main leader of the Dutch Revolt against the Spanish Habsburgs...\"\n\nIt doesn't mention where he died. So, the answer based on the passages is that the location isn't provided. But since the question is expecting an answer, perhaps the passages do mention it elsewhere.\n\nWait, another passage mentions:\n\n\"In 1625 he had to surrender Breda to the Spanish general Ambrogio Spinola after a siege of 11 months. Justinus was allowed to leave for Leiden.\"\n\nBut that's about Justinus, not his father. \n\nAnother passage about Willem van Nassau, Lord of De Lek, mentions he died on August 18, 1627, but that's his death, not his father's.\n\nWait, the passage about William of Orange, Lord of De Lek, is actually about his son, not the father. So, the father, William the Silent, died in 1584, but the passages don't specify the location.\n\nTherefore, based on the given passages, the answer isn't provided. But since the user is asking for the answer, perhaps the intended answer is Delft, Netherlands, as that's where William the Silent was killed. However, since the passages don't specify, I can't be certain.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me read all passages carefully again. \n\nLooking at the passage about William I, Prince of Orange, it says he was the main leader of the Dutch Revolt and died in 1584. It doesn't mention where. \n\nAnother passage about Faustus Cornelius Sulla mentions he was buried in Westminster Abbey, but that's a different person.\n\nWait, the passage about George Richard Savage Nassau mentions he was buried in Arlington National Cemetery, but that's another person.\n\nSo, no, the only death location mentioned is in the passage about Faustus Sulla, but that's not relevant. Therefore, the answer based on the passages is that the location isn't provided. However, since the user expects an answer, perhaps the intended answer is Delft, Netherlands, but I can't confirm it from the given passages.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm wrong. Let me check the passage again. It says:\n\n\"William I, Prince of Orange (24 April 1533 – 10 July 1584), also known as William the Silent or William the Taciturn (translated from), or more commonly known as William of Orange, was the main leader of the Dutch Revolt against the Spanish Habsburgs that set off the Eighty Years' War (1568–1648) and resulted in the formal independence of the United Provinces in 1581. He was born in the House of Nassau as Count of Nassau-Dillenburg. He became Prince of Orange in 1544 and is thereby the founder of the branch House of Orange-Nassau and the ancestor of the monarchy of the Netherlands. Within the Netherlands, he is also known as Father of the Fatherland. A wealthy nobleman, William originally served the Habsburgs as a member of the court of Margaret of Parma, governor of the Spanish Netherlands. Unhappy with the centralisation of political power away from the local estates and with the Spanish persecution of Dutch Protestants, William joined the Dutch uprising and turned against his former masters. The most influential and politically capable of the rebels, he led the Dutch to several successes in the fight against the Spanish. Declared an outlaw by the Spanish king in 1580, and became the father of the new line of the Dukes of Jülich- Berg and Counts of Ravensberg, when his brother Adolf died without an heir. William and Adelheid are buried in the Stiftskirche in Bielefeld.\"\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. The passage about William I, Prince of Orange, doesn't mention where he was buried. The part about being buried in the Stiftskirche is in another passage about Wilhelm Heinrich, the Duke of Saxe-Eisenach.\n\nSo, the passage about William I, Prince of Orange, only mentions his death date, not the location.
