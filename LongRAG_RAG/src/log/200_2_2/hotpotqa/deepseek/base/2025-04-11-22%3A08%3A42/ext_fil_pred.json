The film crew visited various states along the border, documenting these activities and their effects on residents.\n\nOn the other hand, \"All in This Tea\" is a 2007 documentary about Chinese tea.

I'll need to find the part that talks about roller coasters with inversions, specifically the type used in Scream.\n\nIn the first paragraph, it mentions that a roller coaster inversion is a track element that turns riders upside-down and back upright. It says early forms date back to 1848 on the Centrifugal Railway in Paris. These were vertical loops, circular, and dangerous, leading to their decline until the Great Depression.

It also notes that Kitsos was the father of Kostas and Markos Botsaris, who fought in the Greek War of Independence.\n\nLooking further, the passage about the Souliotes says they were an Orthodox Christian community. It mentions that they spoke Albanian in addition to Greek because of their Albanian origin. The term \"Greek\" here refers to their classification under the Ottoman system as Orthodox Christians, which was typical for non-Muslims in the empire.\n\nThere's also a part about the Bahá'í Faith in Spain, but that's unrelated to Kitsos Botsaris.

I need to find a Fortune 500 company that produces both potash and phosphate fertilizer and had a president and CEO who served from January 2007 to August 2015.\n\nFirst, I'll look through the passages to identify companies that produce both potash and phosphate. The passages mention two companies: The Mosaic Company and The Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan (PotashCorp).\n\nThe Mosaic Company is based in Plymouth, Minnesota, and is described as a Fortune 500 company. It mines phosphate and potash and produces specialty fertilizers. It's noted as the largest U.S. producer of both potash and phosphate fertilizer.\n\nPotashCorp, on the other hand, is a Canadian company based in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. While it is the world's largest potash producer and a significant player in nitrogen and phosphate production, it's not specified as a Fortune 500 company in the passages. Additionally, the question seems to focus on a U.S.-based company, given that The Mosaic Company is highlighted as a Fortune 500 company.\n\nNext, I'll look for information about the CEO who served from January 2007 to August 2015. The passages mention James T. Prokopanko, who served as the president and CEO of The Mosaic Company during that time frame.\n\nPutting this together, The Mosaic Company fits all the criteria: it's a Fortune 500 company, produces both potash and phosphate fertilizer, and had James T.

The song was written by Alan Menken and Stephen Schwartz. Now, I need to find out who the singer is. Continuing through the passages, I see that Carrie Underwood is mentioned as the singer of \"Ever Ever After.\" It says, \"The song, which was the last of several written for the film, appears as the fifth track on its soundtrack album.

To confirm, I can think about other cities in Olmsted County. For example, I know that the Mayo Clinic is in Rochester, which is a significant landmark there. \n\nI don't see any conflicting information in the provided text about KYBA's location.

The passage mentions that the draft took place on June 27, 2001, and that the Seattle Supersonics participated in this draft. However, the passage doesn't explicitly mention Ear Joseph. \n\nGiven that the question links both events to the same draft, and knowing that Kwame Brown's draft was in 2001, it's reasonable to conclude that the 2001 NBA Draft is the answer, even if Ear Joseph isn't detailed in the provided information.\n\nSo, the draft in question is the 2001 NBA Draft.\n</think>\n\nThe NBA Draft in question is the 2001 NBA Draft.\n\nAnswer: The 2001 NBA Draft.", "input_len": 6709}

", "ext_fil_pred": "Alright, so I'm trying to answer this question about mutualism and mutual-credit banks. The question is a bit dense, but I'll break it down step by step. First, I need to understand what mutualism is. From the provided passages, mutualism is an economic theory and an anarchist school of thought. It advocates for a society where each person can own a means of production, either individually or in \"purely ? collectives.\" There's a question mark there, so I need to figure out what kind of collectives are being referred to.\n\nLooking further into the passages, mutualism is based on a labor theory of value, which means that when labor or its product is sold, it should receive goods or services that embody an equivalent amount of labor. This ties into the idea of trade representing equivalent amounts of labor in the free market. Integral to mutualism is the establishment of a mutual-credit bank. \n\nNow, the question also asks about mutual-credit banks. From the passages, a mutual-credit bank is a financial institution chartered by a central or regional government, without capital stock, and owned by its members who subscribe to a common fund. These banks lend to producers at a minimal interest rate, just enough to cover administration costs.\n\nPutting this together, mutualism is about individuals owning means of production either individually or in certain types of collectives, and mutual-credit banks are specific financial institutions that support this economic model by providing loans to producers.\n\nThe question is asking to fill in the blank in the sentence about collectives and confirm the description of mutual-credit banks. From the passages, the collectives are \"purely voluntary,\" and the mutual-credit banks are as described: chartered by government, without capital stock, owned by members with a common fund.\n\nSo, the answer should fill in \"voluntary\" for the collectives and confirm that mutual-credit banks are financial institutions owned by members with a common fund, chartered by government, and without capital stock.\n</think>\n\nThe missing word in the sentence about collectives is \"voluntary,\" and mutual-credit banks are financial institutions chartered by a government, owned by members with a common fund, and without capital stock.\n\nAnswer: voluntary", "input_len": 8262}

But it doesn't provide the number of injured people. I'll need to look elsewhere in the passages for that information.\n\nLooking through the other passages, I see multiple mentions of tornado events. The first paragraph repeats the information about Plaza Towers, so no new details there. The next paragraphs discuss the 1968 Tracy tornado, which injured 125 people, and the 1956 tornado outbreak, which injured 340 people. These are different events, so I can disregard them for this question.\n\nThen, there's a detailed description of the 2013 Moore tornado, which mentions that it killed 24 people and injured 377 others. This must be the same tornado that destroyed Plaza Towers' previous facility. The other passages about the 2008 Carolinas outbreak, the 2001 Myrtle Beach tornadoes, and others are not relevant here.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the 2013 Moore tornado injured 377 people, which is the answer to how many were injured when Plaza Towers' previous facility was destroyed.\n\n**Answer:** 377\n</think>\n\n377\n\nAnswer: 377", "input_len": 16182}

I remember that it was released in 2003 as a single and was a bonus track on their collection \"Singles 93–03\". The music video was directed by Joseph Kahn and featured a martial arts film called \"2 Champions of Shaolin\". \n\nNow, the Grammy Awards happen annually, and each year they honor achievements in music from the previous year. So if the song was released in 2003, it would have been eligible for Grammy nominations in 2004. That makes sense because Grammy nominations are typically announced in late December, and the ceremony is held in February of the following year.\n\nLooking at the background information provided, it mentions that \"Get Yourself High\" was nominated for a Grammy for Best Dance Recording. It also notes that it lost to \"Toxic\" by Britney Spears.

He represents Laghman Province. So, the key point here is that he's from Laghman Province.\n\nNow, I need to find the capital of Laghman Province. Looking through the background, there's a section that mentions Laghman Province. It says, \"The city of Mihtarlam serves as the capital of the province.\" That seems straightforward.\n\nI don't see any conflicting information elsewhere in the text. Other parts talk about other provinces and their representatives, but since the question is specifically about Laghman Province, I can focus on that section.\n\nTo make sure I'm not missing anything, I'll double-check the entire text. There's a mention of the National Assembly of Eritrea, but that's unrelated. Similarly, other parts discuss different countries and their political figures, but nothing that contradicts the information about Laghman Province.\n\nSo, putting it all together, Hajji Moharam Khan Nasiri represents Laghman Province, and the capital of that province is Mihtarlam.

{"question": "The artist that made \"One Heartbeat\" was born in what year?", "ext_fil_pred": "Alright, so I need to figure out the birth year of the artist who made the song \"One Heartbeat.\" Let me go through the provided background information step by step.\n\nFirst, I see that \"One Heartbeat\" is mentioned twice. The first mention is about a 1987 album by Smokey Robinson. It says, \"One Heartbeat is a million-selling 1987 album by R&B singer/songwriter Smokey Robinson.\" So, Smokey Robinson is the artist here. The second mention is a song titled \"Just to See Her\" from the same album, written by Jimmy George and Lou Pardini and recorded by Smokey Robinson. So, that confirms that Smokey Robinson is the artist in question.\n\nNow, I need to find out when Smokey Robinson was born. Looking through the text, I don't see his birth year mentioned directly. Wait, there's another part about Mark Cahill, an author and evangelist, but that's not relevant here. Then there's information about various other artists like Amy Grant, Billy Ray Cyrus, Britney Spears, and others, but none of them are connected to \"One Heartbeat.\"\n\nWait, I think I might have missed something. Let me go back. The first paragraph clearly states that Smokey Robinson is the artist for the album \"One Heartbeat.\" So, I should focus on finding his birth year elsewhere in the text.\n\nLooking again, I don't see Smokey Robinson's birth year mentioned. The other artists have their birth years listed, like Mark Cahill was born in 1962, Amy Grant's details, Billy Ray Cyrus's details, etc. But Smokey Robinson's birth year isn't provided in the given text.\n\nHmm, that's a problem. Since the user is asking for the birth year based on the provided background, and it's not there, I might have to conclude that the information isn't available in the given text. Alternatively, perhaps I overlooked it. Let me check once more.\n\nWait, in the background, under \"Mark Cahill,\" it says he's the author of books like \"One Thing You Can’t Do in Heaven\" and \"One Heartbeat Away.\" But that's a different person. Then, under \"Heart Records and Tapes,\" it's about a Canadian label, not relevant. Then Amy Grant's info, which includes her Christian music career, but that's a different artist.\n\nSo, the only mention of \"One Heartbeat\" is by Smokey Robinson, but his birth year isn't provided here. Therefore, based solely on the given text, I can't determine Smokey Robinson's birth year.\n\nAnswer the question based on the given passages. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nQuestion: The artist that made \"One Heartbeat\" was born in what year?\nAnswer:", "input_len": 18676}

The question is asking about a person who is currently a Principal and Vice President of a privately held company that invests in real estate. Additionally, this person was instrumental in the formulation and growth of the Live! brand. \n\nFirst, I'll look through the provided passages to identify who fits these criteria. \n\nIn the first passage, we're introduced to Blake L. Cordish. He is indeed a Principal and Vice President of The Cordish Companies, which is a privately held company. The company invests in real estate, as evidenced by their projects like the Inner Harbor in Baltimore. Furthermore, Blake was instrumental in the formulation and growth of the Live! brand, which is part of their entertainment and casino developments. This makes Blake L. Cordish a strong candidate for the person in question.\n\nLooking at the second passage, Sean J. Conlon is mentioned. He is a chairman and founder of several real estate-related companies and a television personality. However, there's no mention of him being involved with the Live! brand, so he doesn't fit the criteria.\n\nOther names mentioned, like Wade Wilson, Jr., Robb LaKritz, Dr. Peter Linneman, Menlo Capital Group, and Bradley Wayne Hughes, don't seem to be connected to the Live! brand either. Therefore, they aren't relevant to the question.\n\nSo, the key here is the Live! brand, which is tied to The Cordish Companies and Blake L. Cordish. Therefore, Blake L.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the distances given. The city is 103 miles south of Edinburgh and 277 miles north of London. That gives me a geographical clue. Edinburgh is in Scotland, and London is in England, so the city in question is somewhere in between, but closer to Edinburgh.\n\nLooking through the background information provided, there are several mentions of cities. The first part talks about Graeme Reginald Morris, born in Newcastle upon Tyne. Then there's Alec Stewart, also born in Newcastle upon Tyne. Later, there's a detailed description of Newcastle upon Tyne, mentioning its location: 103 miles south of Edinburgh and 277 miles north of London. That matches the distances given in the question.\n\nSo, the city in question is Newcastle upon Tyne. Now, I need to find the former English cricketer born there. From the background, Graeme Reginald Morris and Alec Stewart were both born in Newcastle upon Tyne. Both are former cricketers.\n\nThe question asks for the name, so I need to determine if both are correct or if there's a specific one intended. Since both are mentioned, but the question refers to \"the former English cricketer,\" it's possible that either could be the answer, but looking back, the first paragraph is about Graeme Morris, and then Alec Stewart is introduced as another cricketer from the same city.\n\nHowever, the question is asking for the name, so both are correct.

Therefore, the cricketers born there are Graeme Reginald Morris and Alec Stewart.\n\nBut in the background, the first paragraph is about Graeme Morris, born in Newcastle upon Tyne. The second paragraph is about Alec Stewart, also born in Newcastle upon Tyne. So both are correct. However, the question is phrased as \"the name,\" singular, so perhaps either is acceptable, but I need to see if there's more context.\n\nLooking again, the question is about a cricketer, and both Graeme Morris and Alec Stewart are cricketers. Since both are from Newcastle upon Tyne, both fit the description. But perhaps the answer expects both names, or the primary one.\n\nWait, in the background, the first paragraph is about Graeme Morris, so maybe that's the intended answer. Alternatively, since the question is about a cricketer, and both are cricketers, but perhaps the answer is both.\n\nBut I think the intended answer is Graeme Reginald Morris, as he is mentioned first. Alternatively, since Alec Stewart is also a prominent cricketer, perhaps the answer is both. But the question is singular, so maybe just one. I'll go with Graeme Reginald Morris as the answer, but I should note that Alec Stewart is also from the same city.\n</think>\n\nThe former English cricketer born in Newcastle upon Tyne, which is 103 miles south of Edinburgh and 277 miles north of London, is Graeme Reginald Morris.

{"question": "For how many teams in Major League did the player who was traded with Bert Bradley to the New York Tank in 1984 play ?", "ext_fil_pred": "Alright, let's tackle this step by step. The question is asking about a player who was traded with Bert Bradley to the New York Yankees in 1984 and how many Major League teams that player played for.\n\nFirst, I need to identify who Bert Bradley is and who he was traded with. Bert Bradley was a Major League Baseball pitcher who played for the Oakland Athletics. Along with Rickey Henderson, he was traded to the New York Yankees on December 5, 1984. So, the player involved in this trade is Rickey Henderson.\n\nNow, I need to determine how many Major League teams Rickey Henderson played for.

It later changed its name to New Jersey State Teachers College at Glassboro in the 1930s, then to Glassboro State College in 1958, and eventually became Rowan University.\n\nSo, putting that together, Rowan University, where Ted Kershner coached and taught, was founded in 1923.\n</think>\n\n1923", "input_len": 16205}

Let me start by going through the provided background information step by step.\n\nFirst, Chitwan National Park is mentioned as being in Nepal. Specifically, it's located in the districts of Nawalparasi, Parsa, Chitwan, and Makwanpur in south-central Nepal. That's clear—it's in Nepal, which is in Asia, not Europe. So Chitwan National Park is definitely not in Europe.\n\nNext, looking at the sites of Japan’s Meiji Industrial Revolution. The user mentioned Iron and Steel, Shipbuilding, and Coal Mining sites. From the background, there's a mention of Maizuru Castle Park in Kofu, Yamanashi, Japan. That's in Japan, so that's in Asia.\n\nThen there's Stone Wall in Takanawa Seashore in Tokyo, Japan. Again, Tokyo is in Japan, so that's Asia.\n\nLooking further, there's a mention of the State-owned Shandong Iron and Steel Group in China, but that's not relevant to Japan's sites. Then, Curtin Village in Pennsylvania, USA, which is related to ironworks. That's in the Americas.\n\nThe 49th Rifle Division is mentioned in the context of the Soviet Union, which is in Europe, but that's a military division, not an industrial site related to Japan's Meiji period.\n\nJon Wolfsthal is a consultant, but he's associated with nuclear policy, not a location. The North Sea is a body of water between Europe and the Atlantic, but it's a natural feature, not an industrial site. Plymouth in England is mentioned, which is in Europe, but it's about its history, not an industrial site related to Japan.\n\nWinston Churchill's later life is discussed, but that's about the UK, not industrial sites. The Dublin Lock-out is in Ireland, which is in Europe, but again, not related to Japan's industrial revolution sites.\n\nPutting it all together, the sites related to Japan’s Meiji Industrial Revolution mentioned are in Japan, which is in Asia. Chitwan National Park is in Nepal, also in Asia. None of these locations are in Europe. Therefore, the answer is that neither Chitwan National Park nor the Japanese Meiji Industrial Revolution sites are located in Europe.\n</think>\n\nChitwan National Park is in Nepal, Asia, and the sites associated with Japan’s Meiji Industrial Revolution, including Iron and Steel, Shipbuilding, and Coal Mining, are situated in Japan, also in Asia.

It also notes that the IIcx had fewer NuBus slots, making it more compact.\n\nFurther down, it specifically states that the idea for the vertical orientation of the IIcx was suggested by Apple's CEO at the time, John Sculley. This design was a significant change because it was the first case designed to operate in either horizontal or vertical orientation, which was quieter and more compact.\n\nLooking through the rest of the passages, there are mentions of other executives like Ron Johnson, Mike Long, and Mike Lunsford, but the key point related to the CEO suggesting a new computer design is clearly tied to John Sculley and the IIcx's vertical orientation feature.\n\nSo, the new computer design suggested by the CEO (John Sculley) was the ability to operate the Macintosh IIcx in either horizontal or vertical orientation, making it more compact and quieter.\n</think>\n\nThe new computer design suggested by the CEO was the ability to operate the Macintosh IIcx in either horizontal or vertical orientation.\n\nAnswer: The ability to operate the computer in either horizontal or vertical orientation.", "input_len": 15284}

The atoll is 1,501 miles east of Guam, 2,298 miles west of Honolulu, and 1,991 miles southeast of Tokyo.\n\nFirst, I'll recall the information given about Hurricane Dora. From the background provided, Dora started as a tropical depression on August 6 and became a tropical storm the same day. It strengthened into a hurricane on August 8 and peaked as a Category 4 hurricane on August 12. After passing south of Hawaii, it weakened to a tropical storm while crossing the International Dateline on August 20. Then, it weakened to a tropical depression on August 22 and dissipated on August 23 north of Wake Island.\n\nWait, the text says Dora dissipated while centered several hundred miles north of Wake Island.

The passage mentions that Temple Bruer with Temple High Grange is in the North Kesteven district of Lincolnshire, England.

Wellingore's population is given as 356 in the 2011 census. Welbourn's population isn't directly mentioned, but since the question specifically asks for the parish to the west, and Wellingore is directly stated as being to the west, I can conclude that Wellingore is the relevant parish.\n\nTherefore, the population of Wellingore parish in 2011 was 356.\n</think>\n\nThe population of Wellingore parish in 2011 was 356.\n\nAnswer: 356", "input_len": 4933}

The key here is to identify which English singer-songwriter he worked with. Looking through the info, I see mentions of Dizzee Rascal, Pink Grease, Franz Ferdinand, Bat for Lashes, Santigold, Hot Chip, Yelle, and Lily Allen.

Let me go through the provided passages step by step to find the correct information.\n\nFirst, I'll look for any mention of songs that peaked at number five on the Hot 100. Scanning through the passages, I see that the album \"Blurryface\" by Twenty One Pilots is mentioned. It includes the songs \"Stressed Out\" and \"Ride,\" which reached numbers two and five, respectively. So, \"Ride\" is the song that peaked at number five.\n\nNext, I need to check when \"Ride\" was released. The passage states that \"Ride\" was originally released as a promotional single on YouTube on May 11, 2015. The question mentions May 12, 2015, which is just one day after. This slight discrepancy might be due to a typo or a difference in release regions, but it's close enough to consider \"Ride\" as the song in question.\n\nNow, I need to determine the lead single of the album \"Blurryface.\" The passage mentions that the lead single for the album was \"Fairly Local,\" released on March 17, 2015. However, \"Ride\" was released as a promotional single before the album's release on May 17, 2015. This means \"Ride\" was an early release but not the official lead single.\n\nThe question specifically asks for the lead single on the album that includes the song that peaked at number five. Even though \"Ride\" was released earlier, the lead single designated for the album is \"Fairly Local.\" Therefore, the answer should reflect that the lead single is \"Fairly Local,\" and the song that peaked at number five is \"Ride.\"\n\nHowever, the question might be interpreted as asking for the single released on May 12, 2015, which aligns with \"Ride.\" But since the lead single of the album is \"Fairly Local,\" I need to clarify which part of the question is being asked. The key here is to identify the lead single of the album, regardless of the release date of another single.\n\nIn summary, the album \"Blurryface\" has \"Fairly Local\" as its lead single, and the song that peaked at number five is \"Ride,\" released on May 11, 2015. Given the slight date difference, it's possible the user intended to refer to \"Ride,\" but the official lead single is \"Fairly Local.\"\n\nAfter considering all this, the most accurate answer based on the passages is that the lead single on the album is \"Fairly Local,\" and the song that peaked at number five is \"Ride,\" which was released on May 11, 2015. However, if the user is asking specifically for the single released on May 12, 2015, there might be a mix-up, but based on the provided information, \"Ride\" is the song that fits the peak position.\n\nAnswer: The lead single on the album is \"Fairly Local,\" while the song that peaked at number five is \"Ride,\" released on May 11, 2015.\n</think>\n\nThe lead single on the album is \"Fairly Local,\" while the song that peaked at number five is \"Ride,\" released on May 11, 2015. \n\nAnswer: The lead single on the album is \"Fairly Local,\" while the song that peaked at number five is \"Ride,\" released on May 11, 2015.", "input_len": 17965}

The user is asking for the drummer of the band that released \"Kill Me\" in 2012. From the provided passages, I know that \"Kill Me\" is by The Pretty Reckless. Now, I need to find out who the drummer is for this band.\n\nLooking through the passages, there's a lot of information about other bands like Green Day, AxeWound, and Kendrick Lamar, but nothing directly about The Pretty Reckless's drummer. However, I recall from general knowledge that The Pretty Reckless has had several drummers over the years. The most recent and well-known drummer is Max Bensley, who joined the band in 2014. Since the song \"Kill Me\" was released in 2012, it's possible that Max Bensley was the drummer at that time, but I'm not entirely sure if he was part of the band back then.\n\nWait, maybe I should double-check. The band's lineup can change, so it's possible that the drummer at the time of \"Kill Me\" was someone else. However, considering the timeline, Max Bensley has been a consistent member since 2014, and the song was released in 2012, which is just a couple of years before he joined. It's likely that he was not the drummer for \"Kill Me\" but became part of the band later.\n\nHmm, this is a bit confusing. I think I need to look up The Pretty Reckless's lineup around 2012 to confirm the drummer's name. From what I remember, before Max Bensley, there was another drummer named Matt Tuck, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe the band didn't have a full-time drummer at the time, or the drummer's name isn't mentioned in the passages.\n\nWait, in the passages, there's a mention of \"The Hunger\" band's drummer, Max Schuldberg, but that's a different band. So, focusing back on The Pretty Reckless, I think the drummer around 2012 was possibly someone else, but I can't recall the exact name. Maybe it's best to go with the most recent and known drummer, Max Bensley, even though he might have joined after the release of \"Kill Me.\"\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the band didn't have a dedicated drummer for that song, or the drummer's name isn't specified in the provided information. In that case, I might not be able to provide an accurate answer based solely on the passages given.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, I'll have to make an educated guess based on what I know.

So, putting that together, the trail connected the Missouri River to the valleys in Oregon.\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm not mixing up any details. The Oregon Trail spanned from the Missouri River east to west, so the starting point was the Missouri River, and it led to the Oregon valleys. The text specifically says it connected the Missouri River to the Oregon valleys, so that's where it ended.\n\nI think that's the answer, but let me double-check.

From the background text, there's a section about Michael Kiske where it mentions he's a German singer. Specifically, it says he's best known as the lead vocalist for the German power metal band Helloween.\n\nI should make sure there's no confusion with other guest appearances mentioned in the text. For example, other albums have their own guest artists like Terri Clark from Canada or Marcella Detroit from the U.S., but the focus here is on Michael Kiske.\n\nSo, putting it all together, Michael Kiske, the guest artist on three tracks of \"Skeletons & Majesties Live,\" is German.\n</think>\n\nGerman", "input_len": 10387}

It mentions that ferries used it for transporting agricultural produce and that it played a role in the Revolutionary War. So, right there, it says it's in Edgewater.\n\nNext, the text goes on to describe Edgewater as a borough along the Hudson River in Bergen County. So that confirms that Burdett's Landing is indeed in Edgewater.\n\nI should make sure there's no conflicting information elsewhere. The following paragraphs talk about Fort Lee, Bergenline Avenue, legislative districts, Ridgefield Township, Route 14, Bergen Township, Briarcliff Manor, the Hudson River, and the Selkirk Hurdle.
