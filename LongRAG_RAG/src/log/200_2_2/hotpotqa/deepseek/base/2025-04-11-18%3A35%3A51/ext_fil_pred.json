The film crew visited various states along the border, documenting these activities and their effects on residents.\n\nOn the other hand, \"All in This Tea\" is a 2007 documentary about Chinese tea. It follows a tea connoisseur as he travels to tea-growing areas in China, focusing on fair trade issues, organic growing methods, and the importance of terroir.

I'll need to find the part that talks about roller coasters with inversions, specifically the type used in Scream.\n\nIn the first paragraph, it mentions that a roller coaster inversion is a track element that turns riders upside-down and back upright. It says early forms date back to 1848 on the Centrifugal Railway in Paris. These were vertical loops, circular, and dangerous, leading to their decline until the Great Depression. Then, in 1975, Arrow Development revived them with the corkscrew, leading to more complex inversions.\n\nNext, the section about \"Scream\" mentions that it's a floorless roller coaster with seven inversions, including zero-g rolls and interlocking corkscrews. It's a mirror image of another roller coaster.\n\nSo, the key here is that Scream uses inversions, and the background explains that the earliest forms of inversions (vertical loops) go back to 1848.
