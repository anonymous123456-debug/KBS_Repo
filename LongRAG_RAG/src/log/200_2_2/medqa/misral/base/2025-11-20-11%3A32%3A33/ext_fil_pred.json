{"question": "A 55-year-old patient is brought to the emergency department because he has had sharp chest pain for the past 3 hours. He reports that he can only take shallow breaths because deep inspiration worsens the pain. He also reports that the pain increases with coughing. Two weeks ago, he underwent cardiac catheterization for an acute myocardial infarction. Current medications include aspirin, ticagrelor, atorvastatin, metoprolol, and lisinopril. His temperature is 38.54°C (101.1°F), pulse is 55/min, respirations are 23/min, and blood pressure is 125/75 mm Hg. Cardiac examination shows a high-pitched scratching sound best heard when the patient is sitting upright and during expiration. An ECG shows diffuse ST elevations and ST depression in aVR and V1. An echocardiography shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment in this patient?", "ext_fil_pred": "D", "input_len": 8547}
{"question": "A scientist is studying the mechanism by which the gastrointestinal system coordinates the process of food digestion. Specifically, she is interested in how distension of the lower esophagus by a bolus of food changes responses in the downstream segments of the digestive system. She observes that there is a resulting relaxation and opening of the lower esophageal (cardiac) sphincter after the introduction of a food bolus. She also observes a simultaneous relaxation of the orad stomach during this time. Which of the following substances is most likely involved in the process being observed here?", "ext_fil_pred": "A, B, C, D, E", "input_len": 9403}
{"question": "A 52-year-old unconscious man is brought to the emergency department. He was found unresponsive on the sidewalk in the snow. He is recognized by the staff as a local homeless man and IV drug user. Rapid warming procedures are initiated. At physical examination, he is dirty and disheveled and unrousable with a blood pressure of 100/76 mm Hg and a temperature of 37.2°C (99°F). He is thin with apparent weight loss. Both arms have indications of recent IV injection stigmata. A head MRI reveals multiple hyperintense signals in the meninges with multiple tiny contrast-enhancing lesions in the cerebellum and cerebral cortex. A chest X-ray is within normal limits. Mild dilatation of the ventricles is also appreciated. Cerebrospinal analysis fluid (CSF) analysis reveals:\nCSF opening pressure 25 cm H20\nCSF total leukocyte count 580/mm3\nLymphocytes 90%\nNeutrophils 10%\nCSF protein 176 mg/dL\nCSF glucose 21 mg/dL\nA specimen stains are positive for acid-fast bacilli. CSF culture is pending. Appropriate antibacterial medication is initiated. Which of the following is true regarding the immediate future management of this patient?", "ext_fil_pred": "A, B, C, D, E", "input_len": 9405}
{"question": "A 65-year-old woman presents to the clinic for a routine checkup. She has unintentionally lost 4.5 kg (9.9 lb) in the past month but denies any other complaints. Her pulse rate is 90/min, respiratory rate is 18/min, temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F), and blood pressure is 150/70 mm Hg. An irregularly irregular rhythm is heard on auscultation of the heart. Neck examination shows a markedly enlarged thyroid with no lymphadenopathy or bruit. Laboratory tests show low serum thyroid-stimulating hormone level, high T4 level, absent thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin, and absent anti-thyroid peroxidase antibody. Nuclear scintigraphy shows patchy uptake with multiple hot and cold areas. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?", "ext_fil_pred": "A", "input_len": 8994}
{"question": "A 31-year-old man presents to the office with complaints of multiple episodes of blood in his urine as well as coughing of blood for the past 3 days. He also reports a decrease in urinary frequency, and denies pain with urination. No previous similar symptoms or significant past medical history is noted. There is no history of bleeding disorders in his family. His vitals include a blood pressure of 142/88 mm Hg, a pulse of 87/min, a temperature of 36.8°C (98.2°F), and a respiratory rate of 11/min. On physical examination, chest auscultation reveals normal vesicular breath sounds. Abdominal exam is normal. The laboratory results are as follows:\nComplete blood count\nHemoglobin 12 g/dL\nRBC 4.9 x 106 cells/µL\nHematocrit 48%\nTotal leukocyte count 6,800 cells/µL\nNeutrophils 70%\nLymphocyte 25%\nMonocytes 4%\nEosinophil 1%\nBasophils 0%\nPlatelets 200,000 cells/µL\n    Urine examination\npH 6.2\nColor dark brown\nRBC 18–20/HPF\nWBC 3–4/HPF\nProtein 1+\nCast RBC casts\nGlucose absent\nCrystal none\nKetone absent\nNitrite absent \n24 hours urine protein excretion  1.3 g\nA renal biopsy under light microscopy shows a crescent formation composed of fibrin and macrophages. Which of the following best describes the indirect immunofluorescence finding in this condition?", "ext_fil_pred": "C. Linear immunofluorescence deposits of IgG and C3 along GBM", "input_len": 8724}
