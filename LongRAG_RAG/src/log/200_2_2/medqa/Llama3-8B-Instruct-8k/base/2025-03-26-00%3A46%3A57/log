[2025-03-26 00:47:06][INFO] - Question: A 55-year-old patient is brought to the emergency department because he has had sharp chest pain for the past 3 hours. He reports that he can only take shallow breaths because deep inspiration worsens the pain. He also reports that the pain increases with coughing. Two weeks ago, he underwent cardiac catheterization for an acute myocardial infarction. Current medications include aspirin, ticagrelor, atorvastatin, metoprolol, and lisinopril. His temperature is 38.54°C (101.1°F), pulse is 55/min, respirations are 23/min, and blood pressure is 125/75 mm Hg. Cardiac examination shows a high-pitched scratching sound best heard when the patient is sitting upright and during expiration. An ECG shows diffuse ST elevations and ST depression in aVR and V1. An echocardiography shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment in this patient?
