The other options (carnival, surprise, spoons, party) do not directly relate to the typical career path or aspirations of a clown. A circus provides a platform for clowns to entertain, which aligns with the profession's nature. Therefore, the most fitting answer is the circus.\n\nHypothetical citation:\nDoe, J. \"Clowns and Carnivals: A Historical Perspective.\" The Journal of Circus Arts and Entertainment, 2015. pp. 123-145.\n\nIn this hypothetical citation, we reference a source that discusses the historical relationship between clowns and carnivals, which could provide context for why a clown might aspire to run away with a circus.
