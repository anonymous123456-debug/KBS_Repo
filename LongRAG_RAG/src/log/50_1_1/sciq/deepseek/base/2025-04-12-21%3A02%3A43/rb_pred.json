{"question": "Which type of energy is the energy of anything in motion?", "rb_pred": "Okay, I need to figure out which type of energy is the energy of anything in motion based on the given external knowledge. Let's go through the information step by step.\n\nThe external knowledge starts by stating, \"Kinetic energy is the energy of anything in motion.\" It then explains how when you kick a ball, the kinetic energy is what's in motion. It also mentions that kinetic energy converts from potential energy. \n\nFurther, it says, \"The energy of motion is called kinetic energy. The energy of motion is kinetic energy, KE.\" This reinforces that kinetic energy is directly related to motion. It also mentions examples like a spinning saw blade doing work, which is kinetic energy in action.\n\nOther parts of the text discuss mechanical energy, which is the sum of kinetic and potential energy, but the question specifically asks about the energy of anything in motion, which points directly to kinetic energy. \n\nLooking at the options provided:\n- choices_1: diffuse energy – not mentioned in relation to motion.\n- choices_2: residual energy – seems like leftover energy, not related to motion.\n- choices_3: kinetic energy – matches the description given.\n- choices_4: physiological energy – related to living organisms' functions, not motion.\n\nSo, the correct answer is choices_3.\n</think>\n\nchoices_3", "input_len": 5858}
