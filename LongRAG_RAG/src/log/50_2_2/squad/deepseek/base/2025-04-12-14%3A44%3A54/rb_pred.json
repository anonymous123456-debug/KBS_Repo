{"question": "Brincourt made preparations to invade which state?", "rb_pred": "Okay, I need to find out which state General Brincourt prepared to invade based on the given passages. Let me read through the passages carefully.\n\nThe first sentence says, \"After running imperial military affairs in the states of Coahuila and Durango, General Agustín Enrique Brincourt made preparations to invade the state of Chihuahua.\" So that clearly states the target state is Chihuahua.\n\nI should check if there's any other mention of Brincourt invading another state, but from the passages, all the subsequent actions seem to be within Chihuahua, like crossing into Ciudad Jiménez, Valle de Allende, and taking control of Hidalgo del Parral. There's no indication he targeted any other state after Chihuahua.\n\nSo, the answer is Chihuahua.\n</think>\n\nChihuahua", "input_len": 6963}
